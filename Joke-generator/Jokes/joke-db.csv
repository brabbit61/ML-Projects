+ACI-Heaven Saint Peter had a terrible cold and fever and didn't think he would last the day minding the Pearly Gates of Heaven.

Take as much time as you need.+ACIAIg- As Jesus pondered who he might use to replace Peter, he decided to handle the job himself. It was a very slow day and no one approached the Gates until late in the afternoon, when in the distance, Jesus saw a bent, white+AC0-haired old man slowly making his way up the path with the aid of a gnarled cane.

+ACI-CLASSIC VERSION: The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out in the cold. MODERN VERSION: The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving. CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food. America is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can it be that, in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so? Then a representative of the NAAGB (National Association of Green Bugs) shows up on Nightline and charges the ant with +ACIAIg-green bias,+ACIAIg- and makes the case that the grasshopper is the victim of 30 million years of greenism. Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries when he sings +ACIAIg-It's Not Easy Being Green.+ACIAIg- Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to it, the +ACIAIg-Temperatures of the 80's.+ACIAIg- Richard Gephardt exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his +ACIAIg-fair share.+ACIAIg- Finally, the EEOC drafts the +ACIAIg-Economic Equity and Anti+AC0-Greenism Act+ACIAIg- retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the, government. Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single parent welfare moms who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3pm when there are no talkshows scheduled. The ant loses the case. The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he's in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him since he doesn't know how to maintain it. The ant has disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper bought by selling most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton standing before a wildly applauding group of politicians announcing that a new era of +ACIAIg-fairness+ACIAIg- has dawned in America.+ACI-

+ACI-Golf Meditations If you really want to get better at golf, go back and take it up at a much earlier age. The game of golf is 90+ACU- mental and 10+ACU- mental. Since bad shots come in groups of three, a fourth bad shot is actually the beginning of the next group of three. When you look up, causing an awful shot, you will always look down again at exactly the moment when you ought to start watching the ball if you ever want to see it again. Any change works for a maximum of three holes . . . or at a minimum of not at all. No matter how bad you are playing, it is always possible to play worse. Never try to keep more than 300 separate thoughts in your mind during your swing. When your shot has to carry over a water hazard, you can either hit one more club or two more balls. If you're afraid a full shot might reach the green while the foursome ahead of you is still putting out, you have two options: you can immediately shank a lay+AC0-up or you can wait until the green is clear and top a ball halfway there. The less skilled the player, the more likely he is to share his ideas about the golf swing. The inevitable result of any golf lesson is the instant elimination of the one critical unconscious motion that allowed you to compensate for all of your many other errors. If it ain't broke, try changing your grip. Golfers who claim they don't cheat also lie. Everyone replaces his divot after a perfect approach shot. A golf match is a test of your skill against your opponents luck. It is surprisingly easy to hole a fifty foot putt ......for an 8. Counting on your opponent to inform you when he breaks a rule is like expecting him to make fun of his own haircut. Nonchalant putts count the same as chalant putts. It's not a gimme if you're still away. The shortest distance between any two points on a golf course is a straight line that passes directly through the center of a very large tree. There are two kinds of bounces+ADs- unfair bounces and bounces just the way you meant to play it. You can hit a two acre fairway 10+ACU- of the time and a two+AC0-inch branch 90+ACU- of the time. Every time a golfer makes a birdie, he must subsequently make two triple bogeys to restore the fundamental equilibrium of the universe. If you want to hit a 7 iron as far as Tiger Woods does, simply try to lay up just short of a water hazard. To calculate the speed of a players down swing, multiply the speed of his backswing by his handicap+ADs- i.e. backswing 20mph, handicap 15, downswing +AD0- 600mph. There are two things you can learn by stopping your backswing at the top and checking the position of your hands: how many hands you have, and which one in wearing the glove. Hazards attract, fairways repel. You can put +ACIAIg-draw+ACIAIg- on the ball, you can put +ACIAIg-fade+ACIAIg- on the ball, but no golfer can put +ACIAIg-straight+ACIAIg- on the ball. A ball you can see in the rough from 50 yards away is not yours. If there is a ball in the fringe and a ball in the bunker, your ball is in the bunker. If both balls are in the bunker, yours is in the footprint. Don't buy a putter until you've had a chance to throw it.+ACI-
+ACI-Milking Cows A salesman's car breaks down, so he asks a farmer to let him spend the night, and the farmer agrees.

+ACI-I had twelve bottles of whisky in my celler, and was told by my wife to empty the contents of each bottle down the sink or else. So I said I would, and proceeded with the unpleasant task.

Yep,+ACIAIg- the mutt replies. +ACIAIg-So, what's your story?+ACIAIg- The mutt looks up and says +ACIAIg-Well, I discovered this gift pretty young and I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA about my gift, and in no time they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, cause no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping. I was one of their most valuable spies eight years running. The jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger and I wanted to settle down. So I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security work, mostly wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings there and was awarded a batch of medals. Had a wife, a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired.+ACIAIg- The guy is amazed.

+ACI-Here's a Plan About 2 years ago my wife and I were on a cruise through the western Mediterranean aboard a Princess ship. At dinner we noticed an elderly lady sitting alone along the rail of the grand stairway in the main dining room. I also noticed that all the staff, ships officers, waiters, busboys, etc., all seemed very familiar with this lady. I asked our waiter who the lady was, expecting to be told she owned the line, but he said he only knew that she had been on board for the last four cruises, back to back. As we left the dining room one evening I caught her eye and stopped to say hello. We chatted and I said, +ACIAIg-I understand you've been on this ship for the last four cruises.+ACIAIg- She replied, +ACIAIg-Yes, that's true.+ACIAIg- I stated, +ACIAIg-I don't understand+ACIAIg- and she replied, without a pause, +ACIAIg-It's cheaper than a nursing home.+ACIAIg- So, there will be no nursing home in my future. When I get old and feeble, I am going to get on a Princess Cruise Ship. The average cost for a nursing home is +ACQ-200 per day. I have checked on reservations at Princess and I can get a long term discount and senior discount price of +ACQ-135 per day. That leaves +ACQ-65 a day for: 1. Gratuities which will only be +ACQ-10 per day. 2. I will have as many as 10 meals a day if I can waddle to the restaurant, or I can have room service (which means I can have breakfast in bed every day of the week). 3. Princess has as many as three swimming pools, a workout room, free washers and dryers, and shows every night. 4. They have free toothpaste and razors, and free soap and shampoo. 5. They will even treat you like a customer, not a patient. An extra +ACQ-5 worth of tips will have the entire staff scrambling to help you. 6. I will get to meet new people every 7 or 14 days. 7. T.V. broken? Light bulb need changing? Need to have the mattress replaced? No Problem+ACE- They will fix everything and apologize for your inconvenience. 8. Clean sheets and towels every day, and you don't even have to ask for them. 9. If you fall in the nursing home and break a hip you are on Medicare+ADs- if you fall and break a hip on the Princess ship they will upgrade you to a suite for the rest of your life. Now hold on for the best+ACE- Do you want to see South America, the Panama Canal, Tahiti, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, or name where you want to go? Princess will have a ship ready to go. So don't look for me in a nursing home, just call shore to ship. P.S. And don't forget, when you die, they just dump you over the side at no charge.+ACI-

Jesus and his disciples were eating at the last supper and Jesus was later deceived and turned over to the Romans by one of his disciples. The Romans took him to be crucified and he was stabbed in his side, made to wear a crown of thorns, and was hung on a cross with nails through his hands. He was buried in a cave which was sealed off by a large boulder.+ACIAIg- St. Peter smiles broadly with delight.

The man stood up on the bar, dropped his trousers, and placed his privates in the alligator's open mouth. The 'gator closed his mouth as the crowd gasped. After a minute, the man grabbed a beer bottle and rapped the alligator hard on the top of its head. The 'gator opened his mouth and the man removed his genitals unscathed as promised.

+ACI-A man received a bill for his as yet unused credit card stating that he owed +ACQ-0.00. He ignored it and threw it away. In April he received another and threw that one away too. The following month the credit card company sent him a very nasty note stating they were going to cancel his card if he didn't send them +ACQ-0.00 by return of post. He called them, talked to them, they said it was a computer error and told him they'd take care of it. The following month he decided that it was about time that he tried out the troublesome credit card figuring that if there were purchases on his account it would put an end to his ridiculous predicament. However, in the first store that he produced his credit card in payment for his purchases he found that his card had been cancelled. He called the credit card company who apologized for the computer error once again and said that they would take care of it. The next day he got a bill for +ACQ-0.00 stating that payment was now overdue. Assuming that having spoken to the credit card company only the previous day the latest bill was yet another mistake he ignored it, trusting that the company would be as good as their word and sort the problem out. The next month he got a bill for +ACQ-0.00 stating that he had 10 days to pay his account or the company would have to take steps to recover the debt. Finally giving in he thought he would play the company at their own game and mailed them a check for +ACQ-0.00. The computer duly processed his account and returned a statement to the effect that he now owed the credit card company nothing at all. A week later, the man's bank called him asking him what he was doing writing a check for +ACQ-0.00. After a lengthy explanation the bank replied that the +ACQ-0.00 check had caused their check processing software to fail. The bank could not now process ANY checks from ANY of their customers that day because the check for +ACQ-0.00 was causing the computer to crash.

+ACI-The Bible According to Kids The following statements about the Bible were written by children and have not been retouched or corrected (i.e., bad spelling has been left in.) In the first book of the Bible, Guinesses, God got tired of creating the world, so he took the Sabbath off. Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree. Noah's wife was called Joan of Ark because Noah built the ark, which the animals came to in pears. Lot's wife was a pillar of salt by day, but a ball of fire by night. The Jews were a proud people and throughout history they had trouble with unsympathetic Genitals. Samson was a strong man who let himself be led astray by a Jezebel like Delilah. Samson slew the Philistines with the axe of the Apostles. Moses led the Hebrews to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread, which is bread without any ingredients. The Egyptians were all drowned in the dessert. Afterwards, Moses went up to Mount Cyanide to find the ten commendments. The first commandment was when Eve told Adam to eat the apple. The seventh commandment is +ACIAIg-Thou shalt not admit adultery+ACIAIg-. Moses died before he ever reached Canada. Then Joshua led the Hebrews in the battle of Geritol. The greatest miracle in the Bible is when Joshua told his son to stand still and he obeyed him. David was a Hebrew king skilled at playing the liar. He fought with the Finkelsteins, a race of people who lived in Biblical times. Solomon, one of David's sons, had 300 wives and 700 porcupines. When Mary heard that she was the mother of Jesus, she sang the Magna Carta. Then the three Wise Guys from the east arrived and found Jesus in the manager. Jesus was born because Mary had an Immaculate Contraption. St. John, the blacksmith, dumped water on his head. Jesus enunciated the Golden Rule, which says do one to others before they do one to you. He also explained that +ACIAIg-Man does not live by sweat alone+ACIAIg-. It was a miricle when Jesus rose from the dead and managed to get the tombstone off the entrance. The people who followed Jesus were called the 12 decibles. The epistles were the wives of the apostles. One of the opossums was St. Matthew who was also a taximan. St. Paul cavorted to Christianity. He preached the holy acrimony, which is another name for marriage. A Christian should have only one spouse. This is called monotony.+ACI-

+ACI-Blonde as a Mother My family physician told me of an incident that actually happened to him back in the early days of his practice.

+ACI-A cowboy named Bud was overseeing his herd in a remote mountainous pasture in California when suddenly a brand+AC0-new BMW advanced toward him out of a cloud of dust.

When he cried out, the Lord appeared and asked, +ACIAIg-Why are you crying?+ACIAIg- The woodcutter replied that his axe has fallen into water, and he needed the axe to make his living. The Lord went down in the water and reappeared with a golden axe. +ACIAIg-Is this your axe?+ACIAIg- the Lord asked.

+ACI-A redneck family from outside Little Rock was visiting a city in the North and they were in a mall for the first time in their lives. The father and son decided to stroll around while the wife shopped. They were amazed by almost everything they saw, but especially by two shiny, silver walls that could move apart and then slide back together again. The boy said, +ACIAIg-Pa, What's'at?+ACIAIg- Pa (never having seen an elevator) said, +ACIAIg-Dunno, son. Ain't never seen nothing like 'at in my whole dang life.

The walls opened and she rolled between them into a small room. The walls closed and the boy and his father watched as small circular numbers above the walls light up sequentially. They continued to watch until the number at the top lit up. And then the small lights commenced to work their way down again. When the walls opened the next time, out stepped a gorgeous, voluptuous, turbo 24+AC0-year+AC0-old blonde woman. Reverently, and without taking his eyes off the babe, Pa said, quietly, +ACIAIg-Boy . . . go . . . git . . . yo . . . Momma.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-I need some advice on what could be a life changing decision. I've suspected for some time now that my girlfriend has been having an affair. The usual signs.

She started going out +ACIAIg-with the girls+ACIAIg- a lot recently although when I ask which girls it is always +ACIAIg-Just some friends from work, you don't know them+ACIAIg-. I always look out for her ride coming home but she always walks from around the corner, I can usually hear a car driving off as she walks towards our house. If it really is a taxi why not just get dropped off in front? I once picked her cell phone up just to see what time it was and she went beserk and screamed that I should never touch her phone again, and why was I checking up on her. Anyway, I have never approached the subject with my girlfriend. I think deep down I just didn't want to know the truth but last night she went out again and I decided to check on her. I decided I was going to hide behind my car which would give me a view of the whole street so I could see which car she was getting out of. It was while I was crouched behind my car that I noticed rust on my exhaust tip. Should I take it to the dealer for replacement, or should I just take the opportunity to buy the aftermarket 3+ACIAIg- I've been looking at.

The man reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tiny rat. He reaches into his other pocket and pulls out a tiny piano. The rat stretches, cracks his knuckles, and proceeds to play the blues.

+ACI-A duck hunter is out one day having no luck. He hunts the whole morning and couldn't get a single kill. On the way home he comes up to a farm house and flying over the barnyard is a big flock of fat mallards. Seeing his last chance for success, he takes aim at what looked like the biggest duck in the flock one and gave it both barrels. The duck fell from the sky and lands in the middle of the barnyard. As the hunter nears the barnyard and the dead duck, he sees he's got himself a beauty. But when he is a mere 20 paces from the duck, a farmer steps out of the barn, picks up the duck and heads for the house. +ACIAIg-Hey+ACEAIgAi- said the hunter, +ACIAIg-Come back with my duck+ACEAIgAi- +ACIAIg-Your duck?+ACIAIg- says the farmer, +ACIAIg-It was lying dead in my barnyard+ADs- it's MY duck.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No+ACE- No+ACE- You don't understand+ACE-, shouts the hunter,+ACIAIg-I shot it and it just happened to fall here.

The hunter gasps, screams like an animal, falls on the ground, curls up in a knot, turns 3 shades of purple, and nearly dies. After a full half hour and with considerable difficulty, the hunter straightens up, gasps again, and in a high strained voice says, +ACIAIg-Now... my... turn+ACE- The farmer reply: +ACIAIg-Nah, I give up.

No one stood up during the pause to offer a reason 'why this couple should not be married'. His reception wasn't disrupted by streakers or smoke+AC0-bombs, and the car the couple was to take on their honeymoon was in perfect working order. When the couple arrived at their hotel and entered the room, Bill even checked for cornflakes in the bed (a gag he had always loved). Nothing, it seemed, was amiss. Satisfied that he had come away unscathed, the couple fell into bed. Upon waking, the couple was ravenous so Bill called down to room service and asked, +ACIAIg-I'd like to order breakfast for two.+ACIAIg- At that moment, a soft voice from under the bed said, +ACIAIg-Make that five.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

So what's your story?+ACIAIg- So the first man replies: +ACIAIg-Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red+AC0-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground+ACE- By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell +AC0ALQ- but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,+ACIAIg- said Peter, and let the man in. The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. +ACIAIg-It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here.+ACIAIg- Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death.

+ACI-A Candle in Rome There once was a husband and wife couple who, trying as hard as they could, were unable to produce little children. After consulting everyone who would listen to their problem, they were still unsatisfied. Finally, they consulted their family priest. +ACIAIg-My children,+ACIAIg- the priest began, +ACIAIg-The Lord will listen to your prayers, and I am sure that you will be blessed with children shortly. In fact, I am planning a stay in Rome, and while I am visiting the Vatican, I will light a candle for you.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Thank you, Father, thank you+ACEAIgAi- said the couple.

While resting on his porch one mid+AC0-summer morning, he remembered the promise of paying a visit that he had made 15 years ago.

More than a dozen children filled the house from top to bottom+ACE- In the midst of all the chaos, stood the wife. +ACIAIg-My dear,+ACIAIg- the priest said, +ACIAIg-your prayers have been answered+ACE- And where is your husband? I wish to congratulate him too on your miracle+ACEAIgAi- +ACIAIg-He just left for Rome,+ACIAIg- she said in a very desperate tone. +ACIAIg-Rome? Why did he go to Rome?+ACIAIg- asked the priest. She hesitated, sobbed, and finally blurted out, +ACIAIg-To blow out that candle+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-
+ACI-Driving Pointiff After getting all of Pope Benedict's luggage loaded into the limo (and he doesn't travel light), the driver notices the Pope is still standing on the curb. 'Excuse me, Your Holiness, 'says the driver,' Would you please take your seat so we can leave?' 'Well, to tell you the truth, ' says the Pope, ' they never let me drive at the Vatican when I was a cardinal, and I'd really like to drive today.' 'I'm sorry, Your Holiness, but I cannot let you do that. I'd lose my job+ACE- What if something should happen?' protests the driver, wishing he'd never gone to work that morning. 'Who's going to tell?' says the Pope with a smile. Reluctantly, the driver gets in the back as the Pope climbs in behind the wheel. The driver quickly regrets his decision when, after exiting the airport, the Pontiff floors it, accelerating the limo to 205 kms.. (Remember, the Pope is German..) 'Please slow down, Your Holiness+ACE- ' pleads the worried driver, but the Pope keeps the pedal to the metal until they hear sirens. 'Oh, dear Lord, I'm going to lose my license +AC0ALQ- and my job+ACE-' moans the driver. The Pope pulls over and rolls down the window as the cop approaches, but the cop takes one look at him, goes back to his motorcycle, and gets on the radio. 'I need to talk to the Chief,' he says to the dispatcher. The Chief gets on the radio and the cop tells him that he's stopped a limo going 155 kph. 'So bust him, ' says the Chief. 'I don't think we want to do that, he's really important,' said the cop. The Chief exclaimed, 'All the more reason+ACE-' 'No, I mean really important,' said the cop with a bit of persistence. The Chief then asked,' Who do you have there, the mayor?' Cop: 'Bigger.' Chief: 'A senator?' Cop: 'Bigger.' Chief: 'The Prime Minister?' Cop: 'Bigger. ' 'Well, ' said the Chief, 'who is it?' Cop: ' I think it's God+ACE-' The Chief is even more puzzled and curious, 'What makes you think it's God?' Cop: 'His chauffeur is the Pope+ACE-'+ACI-
+ACI-Settling Disputes There was once a Scotsman and an Englishman who lived next door to each other. The Scotsman owned a hen and each morning would look in his garden and pick up one of his hen's eggs for breakfast. One day he looked into his garden and saw that the hen had laid an egg in the Englishman's garden. He was about to go next door when he saw the Englishman pick up the egg. The Scotsman ran up to the Englishman and told him that the egg belonged to him because he owned the hen. The Englishman disagreed because the egg was laid on his property. They argued for a while until finally the Scotsman said, +ACIAIg-In my family we normally solve disputes by the following actions: I kick you in the groin and time how long it takes you to get back up, then you kick me in the groin and time how long it takes for me to get up, whomever gets up quicker wins the egg.+ACIAIg- The Englishman agreed to this and so the Scotsman found his heaviest pair of boots and put them on, he took a few steps back, then ran toward the Englishman and kicked as hard as he could in the groin. The Englishman fell to the floor clutching his groin, howling in agony for 30 minutes. Eventually the Englishman stood up and said, +ACIAIg-Now it's my turn to kick you.+ACIAIg- The Scotsman said, +ACIAIg-Keep the damn egg.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-Bilingual Lawyer A Mexican bandit made a specialty of crossing the Rio Grande from time to time and robbing banks in Texas. Finally, a reward was offered for his capture, and an enterprising Texas Ranger decided to track him down. After a lengthy search, he traced the bandit to his favorite cantina, snuck up behind him, put his trusty six+AC0-shooter to the bandit's head, and said, +ACIAIg-You're under arrest. Tell me where you hid the loot or I'll blow your brains out.+ACIAIg- But the bandit didn't speak English, and the Ranger didn't speak Spanish. Fortunately, a bilingual lawyer was in the saloon and translated the Ranger's message.

The lawyer answered, +ACIAIg-He said 'get lost, Gringo. You wouldn't dare shoot me.'+ACIAIg-+ACI-

Clyde thanked the Judge and proceeded. +ACIAIg-Well as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my favorite mule, into the trailer and was driving her down the highway when this huge semi+AC0-truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my truck right in the side. I was thrown into one ditch and Bessie was thrown into the other. I was hurting, real bad and didn't want to move. However, I could hear ole Bessie moaning and groaning.

After he looked at her, and saw her fatal condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes. Then the Patrolman came across the road, gun still in hand, looked at me and said, +ACIAIg-How are you feeling?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Now what the hell would you say?+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-A helicopter was flying around above Seattle yesterday when an electrical malfunction disabled all of the aircraft's electronic navigation and communication equipment. Due to the clouds and haze the pilot could not determine his position or course to steer to the airport. The pilot saw a tall building, flew toward it, circled, drew a handwritten sign and held it in the helicopter's window. The sign said +ACIAIg-WHERE AM I?+ACIAIg- in large letters. People in the tall building quickly responded to the aircraft, drew a large sign and held it in a building window. Their sign said, +ACIAIg-YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER.+ACIAIg- The pilot smiled, waved, looked at his map and determined the course to steer to SEATAC (Seattle/Tacoma) airport and landed safely. After they were on the ground, the co+AC0-pilot asked the pilot how the +ACIAIg-YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER+ACIAIg- sign helped determine their position. The pilot responded, +ACIAIg-I knew that had to be the MICROSOFT building because they gave me a technically correct but completely useless reply.+ACI-
+ACI-Now while I enjoy the occasional nonsensical joke (Two ducks are sitting in a bathtub, one says, +ACIAIg-Pass the soap,+ACIAIg- so the other says, +ACIAIg-What do I look like, a typewriter?+ACIAIg-), that's not why I find the +ACIAIg-difference between a duck+ACIAIg- joke so funny. Now a joke isn't funny if you have to explain it, but so many people have been expressing their incredulity at it that I feel compelled to defend it (and hopefully clear myself of the charges of witlessness). I always thought it was a very unique kind of joke I haven't heard any quite like it. First, I think the question itself is funny. Why? Because it just fails to make sense at the last moment. Any way you attempt to parse it you get thrown for a loop. I guess it's a matter of taste whether you enjoy that or not. The first answer continues in that vein with the same singular/plural confusion: It would make sense if it was +ACIAIg-One of its legs is the same as...+ACIAIg- or +ACIAIg-Both of its legs are the same.+ACIAIg- Pieces of it make sense but not the whole put together I think it's something like a linguistic equivalent of the Penrose triangle. Actually, I think it is the equivalent, because that's exactly the same sense of amusement I get. The second answer is the same, but additionally you can have fun trying to visualize the ludicrous image of a duck banging its head together when it walks. The last one is just funny because it's absurd. I can't explain, just try to imagine acting it out to somebody. By now, apart from thinking the joke is unfunny, you're also thinking what a loser this guy is trying to explain a bad joke and making a fool of himself in the process, so I'll just shut up now. But not before telling you the one about... ...the Buddhist who walks up to a hot dog vendor and says, +ACIAIg-Make me one with everything.+ACIAIg- ... Oh, and when the guy hands him a hot dog, the Buddhist pays him and asks for his change. So the guy smiles and says, +ACIAIg-Change comes from within.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-WANTED FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER (actual AP headline) Linda Burnett, 23, a resident of San Diego, was visiting her inlaws, and while there, she went to a nearby supermarket to pick up some groceries. Several people noticed her sitting in her car with the windows rolled up and with her eyes closed, with both hands behind the back of her head. One customer who had been at the store for a while became concerned and walked over to the car. He noticed that Linda's eyes were now open, and she looked very strange. He asked her if she was okay, and Linda replied that she'd been shot in the back of the head, and had been holding her brains in for over an hour. The man called the paramedics, who broke into the car because the doors were locked and Linda refused to remove her hands from her head. When they finally got in, they found that Linda had a wad of bread dough on the back of her head. A Pillsbury biscuit canister had exploded from the heat, making a loud noise that sounded like a gunshot, and the wad of dough hit her in the back of her head. When she reached back to find out what it was, she felt the dough and thought it was her brains. She initially passed out, but quickly recovered and tried to hold her brains in for over an hour until someone noticed and came to her aid. And, yes, Linda is a blonde.+ACI-

+ACI-Cat's guide to caring for your human Cats are beautiful, sophisticated, intelligent creatures. And with a little love and caring, they can keep a human being alive for upwards of seventy to eighty years. If you follow these simple instructions, you can have your human housetrained in no time. CLEANLINESS: For some reasons, humans seem to enjoy immersing themselves in running water. Attempts to get humans to lick themselves clean have proven interesting, if unproductive. COMMUNICATION: Humans are unable to speak a proper language. Therefore, you should communicate a point loudly, repeatedly, and if at all possible, at about three in the morning. Any attempts at human+AC0-to+AC0-cat communication can be dealt with by simply ignoring it until it stops. FEEDING: Morning feeding should start promptly when your human is fast asleep, preferably three or four minutes before the alarm is supposed to go off. Recommended methods of waking your human include: sitting on its face, screaming in its ear, and biting its hair. MATING: Human mating behavior is fascinating. Unfortunately, humans tend to get easily spooked by prolonged study of courtship rituals, and resort to shoe+AC0-throwing behavior. TOILET TRAINING: A human's natural tendency is to not change your litter box. Although experts in human behavior believe it can be attributed to the +ACIAIg-laziness reflex,+ACIAIg- this can be easily corrected through what is called +ACIAIg-shoe therapy.+ACIAIg- Just remember that a human shoe looks a lot like a human toilet, and you should be fine. Following these simple tips is the first step towards a long and productive cat/human relationship.+ACI-
+ACI-Fantastic Watch Jake is struggling through a bus station with two huge and obviously heavy suitcases when a stranger walks up to him and asks, +ACIAIg-Have you got the time?+ACIAIg- Jake sighs, puts down the suitcases and glances at his wrist. +ACIAIg-It's a quarter to six,+ACIAIg- he says. +ACIAIg-Hey, that's a pretty fancy watch+ACEAIgAi- exclaims the stranger.

+ACI-A Skier's Dictionary Alp: One of a number of ski mountains in Europe. Also a shouted request for assistance made by a European skier on a U.S. mountain. An appropriate reply: +ACIAIg-What Zermatter?+ACIAIg- Avalanche: One of the few actual perils skiers face that needlessly frighten timid individuals away from the sport. See also: Blizzard, Fracture, Frostbite, Hypothermia, Lift Collapse. Bindings: Automatic mechanisms that protect skiers from potentially serious injury during a fall by releasing skis from boots, sending the skis skittering across the slope where they trip two other skiers, and so on and on, eventually causing the entire slope to be protected from serious injury. Bones: There are 206 in the human body. No need for dismay, however: TWO bones of the middle ear have never been broken in a skiing accident. Cross+AC0-Country Skiing: Traditional Scandinavian all+AC0-terrain snow+AC0-travelling technique. It's good exercise. It doesn't require the purchase of costly lift tickets. It has no crowds or lines. It isn't skiing. See Cross+AC0-Country Something+AC0-Or+AC0-Other. Cross+AC0-Country Something+AC0-or+AC0-Other: Touring on skis along trails in scenic wilderness, gliding through snow+AC0-hushed woods far from the hubbub of the ski slopes, hearing nothing but the whispery hiss of the skis slipping through snow and the muffled tinkle of car keys dropping into the puffy powder of a deep, wind+AC0-sculpted drift. Exercises: A few simple warm+AC0-ups to make sure you're prepared for the slopes: +ACo-Tie a cinder block to each foot with old belts and climb a flight of stairs. +ACo-Sit on the outside of a second+AC0-story window ledge with your skis on and your poles in your lap for 30 minutes. +ACo-Bind your legs together at the ankles, lie flat on the floor+ADs- then, holding a banana in each hand, get to your feet. Gloves: Designed to be tight enough around the wrist to restrict circulation, but not so close+AC0-fitting as to allow any manual dexterity+ADs- they should also admit moisture from the outside without permitting any dampness within to escape. Gravity: One of four fundamental forces in nature that affect skiers. The other three are the strong force, which makes bindings jam+ADs- the weak force, which makes ankles give way on turns+ADs- and electromagnetism, which produces dead batteries in expensive ski+AC0-resort parking lots. See Inertia. Inertia: Tendency of a skier's body to resist changes in direction or speed due to the action of Newton's First Law of Motion. Goes along with these other physical laws: +ACo- Two objects of greatly different mass falling side by side will have the same rate of descent, but the lighter one will have larger hospital bills. +ACo- Matter can neither be created nor destroyed, but if it drops out of a parka pocket, don't expect to encounter it again in our universe. +ACo- When an irresistible force meets an immovable object, an unethical lawyer will immediately appear. Prejump: Maneuver in which an expert skier makes a controlled jump just ahead of a bump. Beginners can execute a controlled prefall just before losing their balance and, if they wish, can precede it with a prescream and a few pregroans. Shin: The bruised area on the front of the leg that runs from the point where the ache from the wrenched knee ends to where the soreness from the strained ankle begins. Ski+ACE- : A shout to alert people ahead that a loose ski is coming down the hill. Another warning skiers should be familiar with is +ACIAIg-Avalanche+ACEAIgAi- +AC0- which tells everyone that a hill is coming down the hill. Skier: One who pays an arm and a leg for the opportunity to break them. Stance: Your knees should be flexed, but shaking slightly+ADs- your arms straight and covered with a good layer of goose flesh+ADs- your hands forward, palms clammy, knuckles white and fingers icy, your eyes a little crossed and darting in all directions. Your lips should be quivering, and you should be mumbling, +ACIAIg-Why?+ACIAIg- Thor: The Scandinavian god of acheth and paineth. Traverse: To ski across a slope at an angle+ADs- one of two quick and simple methods of reducing speed. Tree: The other method.+ACI-

That way they have to remove all your staples rearrange your paperwork and re+AC0-staple it (on the left side). +AC0ALQ-Line the bottom of your envelope with elmer's glue and let it dry before you put in your forms, so that the automated opener doesn't open it and the extractor has to open it by hand. +AC0ALQ-If your very unfortunate and have to pay taxes use a two or three party check. +AC0ALQ-On top of paying with a three party check pay one of the dollars you owe in cash. When an extractor receives cash, no matter how small an amount, he has to take it to a special desk and fill out of few nasty forms. +AC0ALQ-Write a little letter of appreciation. Any letter received has to read and stamped regardless of what it is or what its on. +AC0ALQ-Write your letter on something misshapen and unconventional. Like on the back of a Kroger sack. +AC0ALQ-When you mail it, mail it in a big envelope (even if its just a single EZi form). Big envelopes have to be torn and sorted differently than regular business size ones. An added bonus to the big envelope is that they take priority over other mail, so the workers can hurry up and deal with your mess. +AC0ALQ-If you send 2 checks they'll have to staple your unsightly envelope to your half destroyed form. +AC0ALQ-Always put extra paper clips on your forms. Any foreign fasteners or the like have to be removed and put away. +AC0ALQ-Sign your name in ink on every page. Any signature has to verified and then date stamped.

+ACI-Also known as 'women's intuition,' this sixth sense thing is no myth. Women seem to know what's going on in their man's lives almost better than they do. Why is this?

+ACI-The Doctor said: +ACIAIg-The good news is I can cure your headaches...The bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.+ACIAIg- Joe was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for.

As Joe looked at himself in the mirror, the salesman said, +ACIAIg-You could use new shoes.+ACIAIg- Since Joe was on a roll, he said, +ACIAIg-Sure.+ACIAIg- The man eyed Joe's feet and said, +ACIAIg-9+AC0-1/2E.+ACIAIg- Joe was astonished. +ACIAIg-That's right. How did you know?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Been in the business 60 years.+ACIAIg- Joe tried on the shoes and they also fit perfectly. As Joe walked comfortably around the shop, the salesman asked, +ACIAIg-How about new underwear?+ACIAIg- Joe thought for a second and said, +ACIAIg-Why not.+ACIAIg- The man stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, +ACIAIg-Let's see, size 36.+ACIAIg- Joe laughed. +ACIAIg-Finally I've got you+ACE- I've worn size 32 since I was 18 years old.+ACIAIg- The tailor shook his head. +ACIAIg-You can't wear a size 32.

+ACI-It's a Hard Life+ACE- If you put a woman on a pedestal and try to protect her from the rat race, you're a male chauvinist. If you stay home and do the housework, you're a pansy. If you work too much, you're avoiding spending time with her. If you don't work enough, you're a good+AC0-for+AC0-nothing lazy bum. If she has a boring repetitive job with low pay, this is exploitation. If you have a boring repetitive job with low pay, you should get off your butt and find something better. If you get a promotion ahead of her, that is favoritism. If she gets a promotion ahead of you, it's equal opportunity. If you mention how nice she looks, it's sexual harassment. If you keep quiet, it's male indifference. If you cry, you're a wimp. If you don't, you're an insensitive bastard. If you make a decision without consulting her, you're a chauvinist. If she makes a decision without consulting you, she's a liberated woman. If you ask her to do something she doesn't enjoy, that's domination. If she asks you, it's a favor. If you appreciate the female form and frilly underwear, you're a pervert. If you don't, you're gay. If you like a woman to shave her legs and keep in shape, you're a sexist. If you don't, you're unromantic. If you try to keep yourself in shape, you're vain and self absorbed. If you don't, you're a slob. If you buy her flowers, you're after something. If you don't, you're not thoughtful. If you're proud of your achievements, you're conceited. If you're not, you're not ambitious. If you're totally beat after a hard day's work, you don't give a crap about other people's needs. If she has a headache, she's tired. If you have a headache, you're a complainer and don't love her anymore. If you want it too often, you're oversexed. If you don't, there must be someone else. And that's the whole truth and nothing but the truth. So help my wife.+ACI-

+ACI-Scientists at Rolls Royce built a gun specifically to launch dead chickens at the windshields of airliners and military jets all travelling at maximum velocity. The idea was to simulate the frequent incidents of collisions with airborne fowl to test the strength of the windshields. American engineers heard about the gun and were eager to test it on the windshields of their new high speed trains. Arrangements were made, and a gun was sent to the American engineers. When the gun was fired, the engineers stood shocked as the chicken hurled out of the barrel, crashed into the shatterproof shield, smashed it to smithereens, blasted through the control console, snapped the engineer's back+AC0-rest in two and embedded itself in the back wall of the cabin like an arrow shot from a bow.. The horrified engineers sent Rolls Royce the disastrous results of the experiment, along with the designs of the windshield and begged the British scientists for suggestions. Rolls Royce responded with a one+AC0-line memo: Defrost the chicken..+ACI-

The Devil turns to God and asked +ACIAIg-Are you going to let hime get away with this blatant dereliction of duty?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Nope.+ACIAIg- Replied God. +ACIAIg-Just watch and learn.+ACIAIg- Father Micheal decided that he aught to drive a distance away so he isn't recognised by any of his parishoners. He drives to High Elms near Farnborough in Kent and manages to get a green fee. Father Micheal lines himself up on the first tee, takes a swipe at the ball and smashes it, straigh and true, past the bunker, splitting the fairway and leaving himself a short pitch to the sloping green. He selects his pitching wedge, takes a practice swing then hits the ball. It lands just inside the greenside bunker, skips on for a bounce or two, then rolls in a slow arc towards the pin, leaving a six inch up+AC0-hill put for birdie which he makes. Father Micheal is delighted. +ACIAIg-You are rewarding him for his slothfulness.+ACIAIg- Says the Devil. +ACIAIg-Shhh.+ACIAIg- Replies God. +ACIAIg-Watch and learn.+ACIAIg- Father Micheal slides his tee shot to the second around the trees on the right, his ball lands in the middle of the fairway leaving no more than a short wedge to the green.

His first ever ace+ACE- +ACIAIg-Come on God, the guy is playing better than professional golf here, do you not care he has bunked off work?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Shhh+ACEAIgAi- Says God. +ACIAIg-Watch and learn.+ACIAIg- Father Micheal continues, either paring or birdying his way around the course. Even the horrendously difficult thirteenth causes no problem to Father Micheal. He completes his round seven under par, has not dropped a shot and played the game of his life. +ACIAIg-Look+ACEAIgAi- Says the Devil, +ACIAIg-This is just cannot right, you have allowed this servant of yours to bunk off work, play the game of his dreams, with your help on occasion I noticed, and as far as I can see, no punishment for his tardiness. If that is how you treat your followers, I really must have got it wrong.+ACIAIg- The Devil is perplexed. +ACIAIg-I just don't understand it.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Ahh but,+ACIAIg- Begins God. +ACIAIg-It is true he has played, probably one of the best rounds ever to be played at High Elms, but, and this is the punishment, who can he tell?+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-A minister concluded that his church was getting into serious financial troubles. Coincidentally, while checking the church storeroom, he discovered several cartons of new bibles that had never been opened and distributed. So at his Sunday sermon, he asked for three volunteers from the congregation who would be willing to sell the bibles door+AC0-to+AC0-door for +ACQ-10 each to raise the desperately needed money for the church. Peter, Paul and Louie all raised their hands to volunteer for the task. The Reverend knew that Peter and Paul earned their living as salesmen and were likely capable of selling some bibles but he had serious doubts about Louie. Louie was just a little local farmer, who had always tended to keep to himself because he was embarrassed by his speech impediment. Poor little Louis stuttered very badly. But, not wanting to discourage poor Louis, the Reverend decided to let him try anyway. He sent the three of them away with the back seat of their cars stacked with bibles and asked them to meet with him and report the results of their door+AC0-to+AC0-door selling efforts the following Sunday which they did. Anxious to find out how successful they were, the Reverend immediately asked Peter, +ACIAIg-Well, Peter, how did you make out selling our bibles last week?+ACIAIg- Proudly handing the Reverend an envelope, Peter replied, +ACIAIg-Father, using my sales prowess, I was able to sell 20 bibles, and here's the 200 dollars I collected on behalf of the church.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Fine job, Peter+ACEAIgAi- The Reverend said, vigorously shaking his hand. +ACIAIg-You are indeed a fine salesman, the Church is indebted to you.+ACIAIg- Turning to Paul, he asked +ACIAIg-And Paul, how many bibles did you manage to sell for the church last week?+ACIAIg- Paul, smiling and sticking out his chest, confidently replied, +ACIAIg-Reverend, I am a professional salesman and was happy to give the church the benefit of my sales expertise. Last week I sold 28 bibles on behalf of the church, and here's 280 dollars I collected.+ACIAIg- The Reverend responded, +ACIAIg-Splendid, Paul. You are truly a professional salesman and the church is also indebted to you.+ACIAIg- Apprehensively, the Reverend turned to little Louie and said, +ACIAIg-And Louie, did you manage to sell any bibles last week?+ACIAIg- Louie silently offered the Reverend a large envelope. The Pastor opened it and counted the contents. +ACIAIg-What is this?+ACIAIg- the Reverend exclaimed. +ACIAIg-Louie, this 3200 dollars+ACE- Are you saying that you sold 320 bibles for the church, door to door, in just one week? Louie just nodded. That's impossible+ACEAIgAi- both Peter and Paul said in unison. +ACIAIg-We're professional salesmen, yet you claim to have sold 10 times as many bibles as we could.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Yes, this does seem unlikely,+ACIAIg- the Reverend agreed. +ACIAIg-I think you'd better tell how you managed this, Louie.+ACIAIg- Louie shrugged. +ACIAIg-I+AC0-I+AC0-I+AC0- re+AC0-re+AC0-really do+AC0-do+AC0-don't kn+AC0-kn+AC0-know f+AC0-f+AC0-f+AC0-for sh+AC0-sh+AC0-sh+AC0-sure,+ACIAIg- he stammered.

+ACI-This guy was so lonely that he decided life would be more fun if he had a pet. So he went to the pet store and told the owner that he wanted to buy an unusual pet. After some discussion he finally bought a centipede (100+AC0-leg bug), which came in a little white box to use for his house. He took the box home, found a good location for the box, and decided he would start off by taking his new pet to the bar for a drink. So, he asked the centipede in the box, +ACIAIg-Would you like to go to Frank's place with me and have a beer?+ACIAIg- But there was no answer from his new pet. This bothered him a bit, but he waited a few minutes and then asked him again, +ACIAIg-How about going to the bar and having a drink with me?+ACIAIg- But again there was no answer from his new friend and pet. So he waited a few minutes more, thinking about the situation. He decided to ask him one more time, this time putting his face up against the centipede's house and shouting, +ACIAIg-Hey, in there+ACE- Would you like to go to Frank's place and have a drink with me?+ACIAIg- A little voice came out of the box: +ACIAIg-I heard you the first time+ACE- I'm putting my shoes on+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

+ACI-A Russian scientist and a Czechoslovakian scientist had spent their whole lives studying the majestic grizzly bear. Each year they petitioned their respective governments to allow them to go to Yellowstone to study these wondrous beasts. Finally, their request was granted and they immediately flew to New York and then west to Yellowstone. They reported to the local ranger station and were told that it was the grizzly mating season and it was much too dangerous to go out and study the animals. They pleaded that this was their only chance. Finally the ranger relented. The Russian and the Czech were given cell phones and told to report in each day. For several days they called in, and then nothing was heard from the two scientists. The rangers mounted a search party and found the scientists' camp completely ravaged. There was no sign of the missing men. They then followed the trail of a male and a female bear. They found the female and decided they must kill the animal to find out if she had eaten the scientists, because they feared an international incident. They killed the female and cut open the bear's stomach and, sure enough, found the remains of the Russian. One ranger turned to the other and said, +ACIAIg-You know what this means, don't you?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Of course,+ACIAIg- the other ranger nodded. +ACIAIg-The Czech is in the male.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-In 1957, several cities were vying to host the 1964 Winter Olympics. Candidates had been eliminated to the point where the only two left were Singapore and Nevers, France.

To bring moral support and entertainment to the workers, they brought in Elvis Presley, who mounted the stage and said, +ACIAIg-Well, today's the day your machine must produce snow. If it belches out steam, the games will go to France. So this is it. It's snow, or Nevers.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-Three Kiwis and three Aussies are traveling by train to a conference. At the station, the three Aussies each buy tickets and watch as the three Kiwis buy only a single ticket. +ACIAIg-How are three people going to travel on only one ticket?+ACIAIg- asks an Aussie. +ACIAIg-Watch and you'll see,+ACIAIg- answers a Kiwi. They all board the train. The Aussies take their respective seats but all three Kiwis cram into a bathroom and close the door behind them. Shortly after the train has departed, the conductor comes around collecting tickets. He knocks on the bathroom door and says,+ACIAIg-Ticket, please.+ACIAIg- The door opens just a crack and a single arm emerges with a ticket in hand. The conductor takes it and moves on. The Aussies see this and agree it was quite a clever idea. So after the conference, the Aussies decide to copy the Kiwis on the return trip and save some money (being clever with money,and all that). When they get to the station, they buy a single ticket for the return trip. To their astonishment, the Kiwis don't buy a ticket at all. +ACIAIg-How are you going to travel without a ticket?+ACIAIg- says one perplexed Aussie. Watch and you'll see,+ACIAIg- answers a kiwi. When they board the train the three Aussies cram into a bathroom and the three Kiwis cram into another one nearby. The train departs.

A few minutes later she looked over and his eyes were fluttering. He opened them, looked directly at her and said +ACIAIg-Hi Beautiful+ACIAIg- and went back to sleep. Well, a little startled and blushing, the wife wondered what he was thinking as he hadn't said anything that sweet to her in ages. A few minutes later, his eyes opened again, and he looked over and said, +ACIAIg-Hi ya Cutie+ACIAIg-. then proceeded to fall back to sleep. Feeling a bit hurt with the downgrade from beautiful to cutie, the wife patiently waited.

+ACI-When George Washington was crossing the Delaware River with his troops, there were 33 (remember this number) in Washington's boat. It was extremely dark and storming furiously and the water was tossing them about. Finally, Washington grabbed Corporal Peters (remember this name) and stationed him at the front of the boat with a lantern. He ordered him to keep swinging it, so they could see where they were heading. Corporal Peters, through driving rain and cold, continued swinging the lantern back and forth, back and forth. Then a big gust of wind and a wave hit and threw Corporal Peters and his lantern into the Delaware. Washington and his troops searched for nearly an hour trying to find Corporal Peters, but to no avail. All of them felt terrible, for the Corporal had been one of their favorites. Sometime later, Washington and his troops landed on the other side, wet and totally exhausted. He rallied the troops and told them that they must go on. Another hour later, one of his men said, 'General, I see lights ahead.' They trudged toward the lights and came upon a huge house. What they didn't know was that this was a house of ill repute, hidden in the forest to serve all who came. General Washington pounded on the door, his men crowding around him. The door swung open, and much to his surprise stood a beautiful woman. A huge smile came across her face, to see so many men standing there. Washington was the first to speak, 'Madam, I am General George Washington and these are my men. We are tired, wet, exhausted, and desperately need warmth and comfort.' Again, the Madam looked at all the men standing there, and with a broad smile on her face, said, 'Well, General, you have come to the right place. We can surely give you warmth and comfort.. How many men do you have?' Washington replied, 'Well, Madam, there are only 32 of us here without Peters.'+ACI-

+ACI-A truck driver would amuse himself by running over lawyers he would see walking down the side of the road. Every time he would see a lawyer walking along the road, he would swerve to hit him, and there would be a loud +ACIAIg-THUMP+ACIAIg- and then he would swerve back onto the road. One day, as the truck driver was driving along he saw a priest hitchhiking. He thought he would do a good turn and pulled the truck over.

Suddenly the truck driver saw a lawyer walking down the road and instinctively he swerved to hit him.

However even though he was certain he missed the lawyer, he still heard a loud +ACIAIg-THUD+ACIAIg-.

+ACI-A married couple went to he hospital to have their baby delivered. Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labour pain to the father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favour of it. The doctor set the pain transfer dial to 10+ACU- for starters, explaining that even 10+ACU- was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labour progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and bump it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20+ACU- pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50+ACU-. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since it was obviously helping out his wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic. When they got home, the mailman was dead on their porch.+ACI-

He started by running his hand across her shoulders and the small of her back. He ran his hand over her breasts, touching them very lightly. Then he proceeded to run his hand gently down her side, sliding his hand over her stomach and then down the other side to a point below her waist. He continued on gently feeling her hips first one side and then the other. His hand ran further down the outside of her thighs. His gentle stroking then started up the inside of her left thigh, stopped and then returned to do the same to her right thigh. By this time the woman was becoming aroused and she squirmed a little to better position herself.

About an hour into the flight, the pilot announced that they had lost an engine, but don't worry, there are three left. However, instead of 5 hours it would take 7 hours to get to New York. A little later, he announced that a second engine failed, and they still had two left, but it would take 10 hours to get to New York. Somewhat later, the pilot again came on the intercom and announced that a third engine had died. Never fear, he announced, because the plane could fly on a single engine. However, it would now take 18 hours to get to new York. At this point, one statistician turned to the other and said, +ACIAIg-Gee, I hope we don't lose that last engine, or we'll be up here forever+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

+ACI-An American tourist in London decides to skip his tour group and explore the city on his own. He wanders around, seeing the sights, occasionally stopping at a quaint pub to soak up the local culture, chat with the locals, and have a pint of stout. After a while, he finds himself in a very nice neighborhood with big, stately residences...no pubs, no stores, no restaurants, and worst of all NO PUBLIC RESTROOMS. He really, really has to go, after all those Guinnesses. He finds a narrow side street, with high walls surrounding the adjacent buildings and decides to use the wall to solve his problem. As he is unzipping, he is tapped on the shoulder by a London police officer, who says, +ACIAIg-I say, sir, you simply cannot do that here, you know.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-I'm very sorry, officer,+ACIAIg- replies the American, +ACIAIg-but I really, really have to go, and I just can't find a public restroom.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Ah, yes,+ACIAIg- said the policeman...+ACIAIg-Just follow me+ACIAIg-.

Manicured grass lawns, statuary, fountains, sculptured hedges, and huge beds of gorgeous flowers, all in perfect bloom. Since he has the policeman's blessing, he relieves himself and feels much more comfortable. As he goes back through the gate, he says to the police officer, +ACIAIg-That was really decent of you... is that what you call English hospitality?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No sir...+ACIAIg-, replied the police officer, +ACIAIg-...that is what we call the French Embassy.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-There was a fly buzzing around a barn one day when he happened on a pile of fresh cow manure. Due to the fact that it had been hours since his last meal, he flew down and began to eat. He ate and ate and ate. Finally, he decided he had eaten enough and tried to fly away. He had eaten too much though, and could not get off the ground. As he looked around wondering what to do now, he spotted a pitchfork leaning up against the wall. He climbed to the top of the handle and jumped off, thinking that once he got airborne, he would be able to take flight. Unfortunately he was wrong and dropped like a rock, splatting when he hit the floor. The moral to the story is: Never fly off the handle when you're full of sh+ACo-t.+ACI-
+ACI-A Catholic priest, a Protestant minister, and a Jewish rabbi were discussing when life begins. +ACIAIg-Life begins,+ACIAIg- said the priest, +ACIAIg-at the moment of fertilization. That is when God instills the spark of life into the fetus.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-We believe,+ACIAIg- said the minister, +ACIAIg-that life begins at birth, because that is when the baby becomes an individual and is capable of making its own decisions and must learn about sin.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-You're both wrong,+ACIAIg- said the rabbi. +ACIAIg-Life begins when the children have graduated from college and moved out of the house.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-Men vs. Women Women A man will pay +ACQ-2 for a +ACQ-1 item he wants. A woman will pay +ACQ-1 for a +ACQ-2 item that she doesn't want. A woman worries about the future until she gets a husband. A man never worries about the future until he gets a wife. A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend. A successful woman is one who can find such a man. To be happy with a man you must understand him a lot +ACY- love him a little. To be happy with a woman you must love her a lot +ACY- not try to understand her at all. Married men live longer than single men, but married men are a lot more willing to die. The most important thing for a woman is financial security. Although this is so important, they still go out and buy expensive clothes and stuff. Although they always buy expensive clothes, they say they never have something to wear. Although they never have something to wear, they always dress beautifully. Although they always dress beautifully, their clothes are always just an old rag'. Although their clothes are always just an old rag', they still expect you to compliment them. Although they expect you to compliment them, when you do, they do not believe you.   Men Any married man should forget his mistakes +AC0ALQ- There's no use in two people remembering the same thing. Men wake up as good+AC0-looking as they went to bed. Women somehow deteriorate during the night. A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn't. A man marries a woman expecting that she won't change +ACY- she does. A woman has the last word in any argument. Anything a man says after that is the beginning of a new argument. There are 2 times when a man doesn't understand a woman: before marriage +ACY- after. All men are extremely busy. Although they are so busy, they still have time for women. Although they have time for women, they do not really care for them. Although they do not really care for them, they always have one around. Although they always have one around them, they always try their luck with others. Although they try their luck with others, they get really ticked off if the first woman leaves them. Although the woman leaves them, they still do not learn from their mistakes and still try their luck with others.+ACI-
+ACI-Cost of Gas When the car engine developed a slight knock, he husband asked his wife if she had bought premium or regular gas, but she couldn't remember. +ACIAIg-You probably got the cheaper gas,+ACIAIg- he said. +ACIAIg-That could account for the roughness of the engine.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No, the gas wasn't cheaper+ACEAIgAi- she replied indignantly. +ACIAIg-Well, how much did it cost?+ACIAIg- asked the husband probing. +ACIAIg-It cost the same as always.+ACIAIg- said the wife. +ACIAIg-I told the man to put in the usual ten dollars worth.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-Pig With a Wooden Leg A traveler was driving through Arkansas when he lost his way and got off the main highway. As he drove by, he saw rows and rows of pigsties and pigpens and pigs running in fields and pigs wallowing in mud. Suddenly, his eye caught something really strange. He did a double take, muttered to himself and then looked a third time. He wondered if he had seen correctly +AC0- it looked like a pig with a wooden leg+ACE- He found the lane to the farm and drove up into the farmyard, where he was met by the farmer. +ACIAIg-Excuse me,+ACIAIg- the traveler said. +ACIAIg-I was just driving by and looking at all your pigs, and I noticed something that I just had to stop and ask about. Tell me, did I see right? Is there really a pig out there with a wooden leg?+ACIAIg- The farmer smiled. +ACIAIg-Oh, that would be old Caesar you saw. He's the finest pig a man could ever hope to have +AC0- and smart+ACE- Well, let me tell you a little about that pig. You see that barge down there on the river? That's a mining dredge, taking out platinum ore. Old Caesar sniffed out the vein and showed us how to set it up. Now that dredge brings me in about +ACQ-120,000 every year. +ACIAIg-There's another thing, too, a little more personal. One night a couple of years ago I got to drinking and I guess I had more than I should have. I passed out drunk, fell down and knocked over a lamp. That started a fire in the house and old Caesar smelled the smoke. He came in the back door, got the wife and kid out, roused me up and got me out. +ACIAIg-There is no question about it +AC0- that night old Caesar saved all our lives and you know that is not the sort of thing a man is going to forget too easily.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Why,+ACIAIg- the traveler said, +ACIAIg-this is all amazing+ACE- I have never heard of a pig like this before+ACE- This is fantastic+ACE- But tell me, how did he get that wooden leg? Was he in a wreck or something?+ACIAIg- The farmer laughed and said, +ACIAIg-Well, naturally, when you have a pig that smart, you don't want to eat him all at one time+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

+ACI-A friend of mine has a big Labrador retriever. While I was buying a large bag of Purina at Wal+AC0-Mart for him, a woman behind me in the check out line asked if it was for a dog (duh?). On impulse, I told her no, I was starting The Purina Diet again, although I probably shouldn't because I'd ended up in the hospital last time. I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms. I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet. The way that it works is you load all your pockets with Purina nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. The food is nutritionally complete so I was going to try it again. I have to mention here that practically everyone in the line was by now enthralled with my story, particularly a tall guy who was behind her. Horrified, she asked if I ended up in the hospital last time because I'd been poisoned. I told her no+ADs- I was sitting in the street licking my balls when a car hit me. I thought the guy behind her was going to have a cardiac, and would require need help as he laughed so hard he fell to the floor.+ACI-

+ACI-A travelling salesman of agricultural machinery was on a three week tour through the hinterlands of southern Arkansas and was visiting one particular farmer. He was standing, alongside of the farmer, leaning on the corral rail +AC0- as he always did before pitching +ACIAIg-the new line of tractors+ACIAIg- +AC0- and looking at all of the farm animals in the barnyard. Seeing one particular pig, he said: +ACIAIg-Say, that sure is a fine hog, but, you know, I have never seen a pig with one wooden leg before.+ACIAIg- The farmer said: +ACIAIg-You see, that there pig is one valuable animal, I can tell you. That there hog saved my life three times.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-The first time was about a month ago. My wife fried potatoes for supper, just the way I like them, and left the frying pan on the stove. About midnight or so, the pig must have smelled the smoke, but be broke out of his pen, butted the house door open with his snout, woke us up and we got out of the house just in time.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-And it wasn't but two weeks later and I was mowing on the back forty and I tipped the tractor over and it pinned me under the rear wheel. Gas was leaking out of the tank onto the hot manifold and that pig must have heard me yelling, because he broke out again, ran up to me, saw what had happened, ran to the neighbour, got help and the neighbour came with his tractor and pulled me free.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-And just last week, I was leading the old dairy bull out to pasture, and he raised up and pulled the ring out of his nose and, quick as two shakes of a dog's tail, he knocked me down. He jumped on me and straddled me with his horns and was about to gore me, when the old pig heard what was going on, broke out again, ran up, got a firm hold on the old bull's tail and I got away.+ACIAIg- Having heard the explanation, the salesman said: +ACIAIg-All well and good, but that doesn't explain why that hog has got a wooden leg.+ACIAIg- The farmer replied: +ACIAIg-Well, in a way, it does. A pig that is that valuable is way too valuable to eat all at one time+ACIAIg-.+ACI-

If you have them, they may be worth much more than 25 cents.The Canadian Mint announced today that it is recalling all of the Newfoundland quarters that are part of its program featuring quarters from each province. +ACIAIg-We are recalling all the new Newfoundland quarters that were recently issued,+ACIAIg- Canadian Mint Deputy Minister Jack Shackleford said Monday. +ACIAIg-This action is being taken after numerous reports that new quarters will not work in parking meters, toll booths, vending machines, pay phones, or other coin+AC0-operated devices.+ACIAIg- The quarters were issued in the order in which the various provinces joined Confederation. and have been a tremendous success among coin collectors worldwide. +ACIAIg-The problem lies in the unique design of the Newfoundland quarter, which was created by a team of Newfoundlanders,+ACIAIg- Shackleford said. +ACIAIg-Apparently, the duct tape holding the two dimes and the nickel together keeps jamming the coin+AC0-operated devices.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-A tourist wanders into a back+AC0-alley antique shop in San Francisco's Chinatown. Picking through the objects on display he discovers a detailed, life+AC0-sized bronze sculpture of a rat. The sculpture is so interesting and unique that he picks it up and asks the shop owner what it costs. +ACIAIg-Twelve dollars for the rat, sir,+ACIAIg- says the shop owner, +ACIAIg-and a thousand dollars more for the story behind it.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-You can keep the story, old man,+ACIAIg- he replies, +ACIAIg-but I'll take the rat.+ACIAIg- The transaction complete, the tourist leaves the store with the bronze rat under his arm. As he crosses the street in front of the store, two live rats emerge from a sewer drain and fall into step behind him. Nervously looking over his shoulder, he begins to walk faster, but every time he passes another sewer drain, more rats come out and follow him. By the time he's walked two blocks, at least a hundred rats are at his heels, and people begin to point and shout. He walks even faster, and soon breaks into a trot as multitudes of rats swarm from sewers, basements, vacant lots, and abandoned cars. Rats by the thousands are at his heels, and as he sees the waterfront at the bottom of the hill, he panics and starts to run full tilt. No matter how fast he runs, the rats keep up, squealing hideously, now not just thousands but millions, so that by the time he comes rushing up to the water's edge a trail of rats twelve city blocks long is behind him. Making a mighty leap, he jumps up onto a light post, grasping it with one arm while he hurls the bronze rat into San Francisco Bay with the other, as far as he can heave it. Pulling his legs up and clinging to the light post, he watches in amazement as the seething tide of rats surges over the breakwater into the sea, where they drown. Shaken and mumbling, he makes his way back to the antique shop. +ACIAIg-Ah, so you've come back for the rest of the story,+ACIAIg- says the owner. +ACIAIg-No,+ACIAIg- says the tourist, +ACIAIg-I was wondering if you have a bronze lawyer.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-A ten+AC0-year+AC0-old boy was failing math. His parents tried everything from tutors to hypnosis, but to no avail. Finally, at the insistence of a family friend, they decided to enroll their son in a private Catholic school. After the first day, the boy's parents were surprised when he walked in after school with a stern, focused and very determined expression on his face, and went right past them straight to his room, where he quietly closed the door. For nearly two hours he toiled away in his room +AC0- with math books strewn about his desk and the surrounding floor. He emerged long enough to eat, and after quickly cleaning his plate, went straight back to his room, closed the door, and worked feverishly at his studies until bedtime.

The boy walked in with his report card +AC0ALQ- unopened +AC0ALQ- laid it on the dinnertable and went straight to his room.

It's called the Test of Three.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Three?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-That's right,+ACIAIg- Socrates continued. +ACIAIg-Before you talk to me about my student let's take a moment to test what you're going to say. The first test is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Oh no,+ACIAIg- the man said, +ACIAIg-actually I just heard about it.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-All right,+ACIAIg- said Socrates. +ACIAIg-So you don't really know if it's true or not. Now let's try the second test, the test of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about my student something good?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No, on the contrary...+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-So,+ACIAIg- Socrates interrupted, +ACIAIg-you want to tell me something bad about him even though you're not certain it's true?+ACIAIg- The man shrugged, a little embarrassed. Socrates continued. +ACIAIg-You may still pass though, because there is a third test +AC0- the filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about my student going to be useful to me?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Well it....no, not really...+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Well,+ACIAIg- concluded Socrates, +ACIAIg-if what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful, why tell it to me at all?+ACIAIg- The man was defeated and ashamed. This is the reason Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem. It also explains why he never found out that Plato was having an affair with his wife.+ACI-

+ACI-INSTRUCTIONS FOR MICROSOFT'S NEW TV DINNER PRODUCT: You must first remove the plastic cover. By doing so you agree to accept and honor Microsoft rights to all TV dinners. You may not give anyone else a bite of your dinner (which would constitute an infringement of Microsoft's rights). You may, however, let others smell and look at your dinner and are encouraged to tell them how good it is. If you have a PC microwave oven, insert the dinner into the oven. Set the oven using these keystrokes: mstv.dinn.//08.5min+AEA-50+ACU-heat Then enter: ms//start.cook+AF8-dindin/yummy+AFwAfA-/yum+AH4-yum:+AC0-)gohot+ACM-cookme. If you have a Macintosh microwave oven, insert the dinner and press start. The oven will set itself and cook the dinner. If you have a Unix microwave oven, insert the dinner, enter the ingredients of the dinner found on the package label, the weight of the dinner, and the desired level of cooking and press start. The oven will calculate the time and heat and cook the dinner exactly to your specification. Be forewarned that Microsoft dinners may crash, in which case your oven must be restarted. This is a simple procedure. Remove the dinner from the oven and enter: ms.nodamn.good/tryagain+AFw-again/again.crap This process may have to be repeated. Try unplugging the microwave and then doing a cold reboot. If this doesn't work, contact your oven vendor. The oven itself is obviously on the blink. Many users have reported that the dinner tray is far too big, larger than the dinner itself, having many useless compartments, most of which are empty. These are for future menu items. If the tray is too large to fit in your oven, you will need to upgrade your equipment. Dinners are only available from registered outlets, and only the chicken variety is currently produced. If you want another variety, call Microsoft Help and they will explain that you really don't want another variety. Microsoft Chicken is all you really need. Microsoft has disclosed plans to discontinue all smaller versions of their chicken dinners. Future releases will only be in the larger family size. Excess chicken may be stored for future use, but must be saved only in Microsoft approved packaging. Microsoft promises a dessert with every dinner after '98. However, that version has yet to be released. Users have permission to get thrilled in advance. Microsoft dinners may be incompatible with other dinners in the freezer, causing your freezer to self+AC0-defrost. This is a feature, not a bug. Your freezer probably should have been defrosted anyway.+ACI-

+ACI-Little Johnny 's next door neighbors had a baby. Unfortunately, the little baby was born with no ears. When they arrived home from the hospital, the parents invited Little Johnny's family to come over and see their new baby. Little Johnny's parents were very afraid that their son would have a wise crack to say about the baby so the dad had a long talk with little Johnny before going to the neighbors. He said +ACIAIg-Now, son... that poor baby was born without any ears. I want you to be on your best behavior and not say one word about his ears or I am really going to spank you when we get back home.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-I promise not to mention his ears at all+ACIAIg- said Little Johnny.

+ACI-A woman and a baby were in the doctor's examining room, waiting for the doctor to come in for the baby's first exam.

She did. He pinched her nipples, then pressed, kneaded, and rubbed both breasts for a while in a detailed examination.

+ACI-FINE This is the word women use to end an argument when they feel they are right and you need to shut up. Never use +ACIAIg-fine+ACIAIg- to describe how a woman looks +AC0- this will cause you to have one of those arguments. FIVE MINUTES This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so it's an even trade. NOTHING This means +ACIAIg-something,+ACIAIg- and you should be on your toes. +ACIAIg-Nothing+ACIAIg- is usually used to describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside down, and backwards. +ACIAIg-Nothing+ACIAIg- usually signifies an argument that will last +ACIAIg-Five Minutes+ACIAIg- and end with +ACIAIg-Fine+ACIAIg- GO AHEAD (With Raised Eyebrows+ACE- ) This is a dare. One that will result in a woman getting upset over +ACIAIg-Nothing+ACIAIg- and will end with the word +ACIAIg-Fine+ACIAIg- GO AHEAD (Normal Eyebrows) This means +ACIAIg-I give up+ACIAIg- or +ACIAIg-do what you want because I don't care+ACIAIg- You will get a +ACIAIg-Raised Eyebrow Go Ahead+ACIAIg- in just a few minutes, followed by +ACIAIg-Nothing+ACIAIg- and +ACIAIg-Fine+ACIAIg- and she will talk to you in about +ACIAIg-Five Minutes+ACIAIg- when she cools off. LOUD SIGH This is not actually a word, but is a non+AC0-verbal statement often misunderstood by men. A +ACIAIg-Loud Sigh+ACIAIg- means she thinks you are an idiot at that moment, and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over +ACIAIg-Nothing+ACIAIg- SOFT SIGH Again, not a word, but a non+AC0-verbal statement. +ACIAIg-Soft Sighs+ACIAIg- mean that she is content. Your best bet is to not move or breathe, and she will stay content. THAT'S OKAY This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can make to a man. +ACIAIg-That's Okay+ACIAIg- means that she wants to think long and hard before paying you back for whatever it is that you have done. +ACIAIg-That's Okay+ACIAIg- is often used with the word +ACIAIg-Fine+ACIAIg- and in conjunction with a +ACIAIg-Raised Eyebrow.+ACIAIg- GO AHEAD+ACE- At some point in the near future, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble. PLEASE DO This is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is giving you the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance with the truth, so be careful and you shouldn't get a +ACIAIg-That's Okay+ACIAIg- THANKS A woman is thanking you. Do not faint. Just say you're welcome. THANKS A LOT This is much different from +ACIAIg-Thanks.+ACIAIg- A woman will say, +ACIAIg-Thanks A Lot+ACIAIg- when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you have offended her in some callous way, and will be followed by the +ACIAIg-Loud Sigh.+ACIAIg- Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the +ACIAIg-Loud Sigh,+ACIAIg- as she will only tell you +ACIAIg-Nothing+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-A photographer for a national magazine was assigned to take pictures of a great forest fire. He was advised that a small plane would be waiting to fly him over the fire. The photographer arrived at the airstrip just an hour before sundown. Sure enough, a small Cessna airplane was waiting. He jumped in with his equipment and shouted, +ACIAIg-Let's go+ACEAIgAi- The tense man sitting in the pilot's seat swung the plane into the wind and soon they were in the air, though flying erratically. +ACIAIg-Fly over the north side of the fire,+ACIAIg- said the photographer, +ACIAIg-And make several low+AC0-level passes.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Why?+ACIAIg- asked the nervous pilot. +ACIAIg-Because I'm going to take pictures+ACEAIgAi- yelled the photographer. +ACIAIg-I'm a photographer, and photographers take pictures+ACEAIgAi- The pilot replied, +ACIAIg-You mean you're not the flight instructor?+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-Johnny and his wife went to the State Fair every year. Every year Johnny would say, +ACIAIg-I'd like to ride in that airplane.+ACIAIg- And every year his wife would say, +ACIAIg-I know, Johnny, but that airplane ride costs ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars.+ACIAIg- This one year Johnny and his wife went to the fair and Johnny said, +ACIAIg-I'm 71 years old. If I don't ride that aeroplane this year I may never get another chance.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-That airplane ride costs ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars.+ACIAIg-, replied his wife. The pilot overheard them and said, +ACIAIg-Folks, I'll make you a deal. I'll take you both up for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not say one word, I won't charge you, but if you say one word it's ten dollars.+ACIAIg- Johnny and his wife agree and up they go. The pilot does all kinds of twists and turns, rolls and dives, but not a word is heard. He does all his tricks over again, but still not a word. They land and the pilot turns to Johnny, +ACIAIg-By golly, I did everything I could think of to get you to yell out, but you didn't.+ACIAIg- Johnny replied, +ACIAIg-Well, I was gonna say something when my wife fell out, but ten dollars is ten dollars.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-Keep this philosophy in mind the next time you hear, or are out to repeat a rumor. In ancient Greece (469 +AC0- 399 BC), Socrates was widely lauded for his wisdom. One day the great philosopher came upon an acquaintance, who ran up to him excitedly and said, +ACIAIg-Socrates, do you know what I just heard about one of your students...?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Wait a moment,+ACIAIg- Socrates replied. +ACIAIg-Before you tell me, I'd like you to pass a little test. It's called the Test of Three.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Test of Three?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-That's correct,+ACIAIg- Socrates continued. +ACIAIg-Before you talk to me about my student let's take a moment to test what you're going to say. The first test is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No,+ACIAIg- the man replied, +ACIAIg-actually I just heard about it.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-All right,+ACIAIg- said Socrates. +ACIAIg-So you don't really know if it's true or not. Now let's try the second test, the test of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about my student something good?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No, on the contrary...+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-So,+ACIAIg- Socrates continued, +ACIAIg-you want to tell me something bad about him even though you're not certain it's true?+ACIAIg- The man shrugged, a little embarrassed. Socrates continued, +ACIAIg-You may still pass though because there is a third test +AC0- the filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about my student going to be useful to me?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No, not really...+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Well,+ACIAIg- concluded Socrates, +ACIAIg-if what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful, why tell it to me at all?+ACIAIg- The man was defeated and ashamed and said no more. This is the reason Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem. It also explains why Socrates never found out that Plato was banging his wife.+ACI-
+ACI-There were three guys talking in the pub. Two of them are talking about the amount of control they have over their wives, while the third guy remained quiet. After a while one of the first two turns to the third and says, 'Well, what about you? What sort of control do you have over your wife?' The third fellow says, 'I'll tell you. Just the other night my wife came to me on her hands and knees.' The first two guys were amazed. 'What happened then?' they asked. She said, +ACIAIg-GET OUT FROM UNDER THE BED AND FIGHT LIKE A MAN+ACEAIgAi-.+ACI-

A few minutes later the son asks, +ACIAIg-Mom, why have I got these great long eyelashes?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-They are there to keep the sand out of your eyes on the trips through the desert.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Thanks Mom,+ACIAIg- replies the son. After a short while, the son returns and asks, +ACIAIg-Mom, why have I got these great big humps on my back??+ACIAIg- His mother replies impatiently, +ACIAIg-They are there to help us store water for our long treks across the desert.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-That's great Mom. So we have huge feet to stop us sinking, and long eyelashes to keep the sand from our eyes, and these humps to store water, but Mom...+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Yes, son?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Do we really need all of these in the zoo?+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-A fire fighter was working on the engine outside the station, when he noticed a little girl nearby in a little red wagon with little ladders hung off the sides, and a garden hose tightly coiled in the middle. The girl was wearing a fire fighter's helmet. The wagon was being pulled by her dog and her cat. The fire fighter walked over to take a closer look. +ACIAIg-That sure is a nice fire truck,+ACIAIg- the firefighter said with admiration. +ACIAIg-Thanks,+ACIAIg- the girl replied. The fire fighter looked a little closer. The fireman noticed the girl had tied the wagon to her dog's collar and to the cat's testicles. +ACIAIg-Little partner,+ACIAIg- the fire fighter said, +ACIAIg-I don't want to tell you how to run your rig, but if you were to tie that rope around the cat's collar, I think you could go faster.+ACIAIg- The little girl replied thoughtfully, +ACIAIg-You're probably right, but then I wouldn't have a siren.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-A lady Canadian libertarian wrote a lot of letters to the government, complaining about the treatment of captive insurgents (terrorists) being held in Afghanistan National Correctional System facilities. She received the following reply: National Defence Headquarters MGen George R. Pearkes Bldg, 15 NT 101 Colonel By Drive Ottawa , ON K1A 0K2 Canada Dear Concerned Citizen, Thank you for your recent letter expressing your profound concern of treatment of the Taliban and Al Qaeda terrorists captured by Canadian Forces who were subsequently transferred to the Afghanistan Government and are currently being held by Afghan officials in Afghanistan National Correctional System facilities. Our administration takes these matters seriously and your opinions were heard loud and clear here in Ottawa . You will be pleased to learn, thanks to the concerns of citizens like yourself+ADs- we are creating a new department here at the Department of National Defence, to be called 'Liberals Accept Responsibility for Killers' program, or L.A.R.K. for short. In accordance with the guidelines of this new program, we have decided to divert one terrorist and place him in your personal care. Your personal detainee has been selected and is scheduled for transportation under heavily armed guard to your residence in Toronto next Monday. Ali Mohammed Ahmed bin Mahmud (you can just call him Ahmed) is to be cared for pursuant to the standards you personally demanded in your letter of complaint. It will likely be necessary for you to hire some assistant caretakers. We will conduct weekly inspections to ensure that your standards of care for Ahmed are commensurate with those you so strongly recommend in your letter. Although Ahmed is a sociopath and extremely violent, we hope that your sensitivity to what you described as his 'attitudinal problem' will help him overcome these character flaws. Perhaps you are correct in describing these problems as mere cultural differences. We understand that you plan to offer counselling and home schooling. Your adopted terrorist is extremely proficient in hand+AC0-to+AC0-hand combat and can extinguish human life with such simple items as a pencil or nail clippers. We advise that you do not ask him to demonstrate these skills at your next yoga group. He is also expert at making a wide variety of explosive devices from common household products, so you may wish to keep those items locked up, unless (in your opinion) this might offend him. Ahmed will not wish to interact with you or your daughters (except sexually) since he views females as a subhuman form of property. This is a particularly sensitive subject for him and he has been known to show violent tendencies around women who fail to comply with the new dress code that he will recommend as more appropriate attire. I'm sure you will come to enjoy the anonymity offered by the burka over time. Just remember that it is all part of 'respecting his culture and religious beliefs' as described in your letter. Thanks again for your concern. We truly appreciate it when folks like you keep us informed of the proper way to do our job and care for our fellow man. You take good care of Ahmed and remember we'll be watching. Good luck and God bless you. Cordially, Gordon O'Connor+ACI-

So he had his secretary send a cheque for +ACQ-250 and enclose the following typed note: +ACIAIg-Dear Madam, Enclosed find a cheque for +ACQ-250 for rent of your apartment. I am not sending the amount agreed upon, because when I rented the place, I was under the impression that: +ACM-1 +AC0- it had never been occupied+ADs- +ACM-2 +AC0- there was plenty of heat+ADs- and +ACM-3 +AC0- it was small enough to make me feel cosy and at home. However, I found out that: +ACM-1 +AC0- it had been previously occupied, +ACM-2 +AC0- there wasn't any heat, and +ACM-3 +AC0- it was entirely too large.+ACIAIg- Upon receipt of the note, the girl immediately returned the cheque for +ACQ-250 with the following note: +ACIAIg- Dear Sir, +ACM-1 +AC0- I cannot understand how you could expect a beautiful apartment to remain unoccupied indefinitely. +ACM-2 +AC0- As for the heat, there is plenty of it, if you know how to turn it on. +ACM-3 +AC0- Regarding the space, the apartment is indeed of regular size, but if you don't have enough furniture to fill it, please do not blame the management. Please send the rent in full or we will be forced to contact your present landlady+ACI-

When she woke up however, she was feeling a little frisky herself and she nudged her husband and said, +ACIAIg-I think I did leave the washing machine door open after all.

This time the smile turned into a grin, so she moved again. The man seemed more amused. When on the forth move, the man burst out laughing. She complained to the driver and had the man arrested. The case came up in court. The judge asked the man what he had to say for himself. The man replied, +ACIAIg-Well your Honour, it was like this.

Then she moved and sat under a sign that said, 'Sloan's Liniment will reduce the swelling,' and I had to grin. Then she placed herself under a sign that said, 'William's Big Stick Did The Trick,' and I could hardly control myself. BUT when she moved the forth time and sat under a sign that said, 'Goodyear Rubber could have prevented this accident,' I laughed out loud.+ACIAIg- The case was dismissed.+ACI-

+ACI-Four college friends were so confident that the weekend before finals, they decided to go up to Dallas and party with some friends up there. They had a great time. However, after all the partying, they slept all day Sunday and didn't make it back to Austin until early Monday morning. Rather than taking the final then, they decided to find their professor after the final and explain to him why they missed it. They explained that they had gone to Dallas for the weekend with the plan to come back and study but, unfortunately, they had a flat tire on the way back, didn't have a spare, and couldn't get help for a long time. As a result, they missed the final. The Professor thought it over and then agreed they could make up the final the following day. The guys were elated and relieved. They studied that night and went in the next day at the time the professor had told them. He placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet, and told them to begin.

They agreed to be faithful to each other and spend anytime they could together.

+ACI-Merv was in a terrible accident at work. He fell through a floor tile and ripped off both of his ears.

One day, Merv decided to invest his money in a small, but growing telecom business called Plexus Communications. After weeks of negotiations, he bought the company outright. But, after signing on the doted line he realized that he knew nothing about running such a business and quickly set out to hire someone who could do that for him. The next day he had set up three interviews. The first guy was great. He knew everything he needed to and was very interesting. At the end of the interview, Merv asked him, +ACIAIg-Do you notice anything different about me?+ACIAIg- And the gentleman answered, +ACIAIg-Why yes, I couldn't help but notice you have no ears.+ACIAIg- Merv got very angry and threw him out. The second interview was with a woman, and she was even better than the first guy. He asked her the same question, +ACIAIg-Do you notice anything different about me?+ACIAIg- and she replied: +ACIAIg-Well, you have no ears.+ACIAIg- Merv again was upset and tossed her out. The third and last interview was the best of all three. It was with a very young man who was fresh out of college. He was smart. He was handsome and he seemed to be a better businessman than the first two put together. Merv was anxious, but went ahead and asked the young man the same question: +ACIAIg-Do you notice anything different about me?+ACIAIg- And to his surprise, the young man answered: +ACIAIg-Yes. You wear contact lenses.+ACIAIg- Merv was shocked, and said, +ACIAIg-What an incredibly observant young man.

+ACI-A nun was in a hurry on her way to her job at the local Catholic Charity Hospital when her car suddenly runs out of gas. Luckily, she was only a block and a half from a gas station, so she got out of her car and quickly walked there. At the station, she asked the attendent to give her a quart of gasoline so that she could start her car and drive it over to fill it up. The attendent told her that he only had one gas can, and he just loaned it to someone else. She told the attendent that she was in a hurry and would look in her car to find something to hold the gas. When she got back the the car, the only suitable container she found was a bedpan, which looked like it could easily hold a quart of gas. She brought the bedpan to the station and the attendent filled it with gas. The nun got back to her car and started to pour the gas from the bedpan into her car. Just as she started pouring, two men walked by. One of the men said to the other +ACIAIg-If that car starts, I'm converting to catholicism forever+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

+ACI-Camping Tips Get even with a bear who raided your food bag by kicking his favorite stump apart and eating all the ants. A hot rock placed in your sleeping bag will keep your feet warm. A hot enchilada works almost as well, but the cheese sticks between your toes. The best backpacks are named for national parks or mountain ranges. Steer clear of those named for landfills. When camping, always wear a long+AC0-sleeved shirt. It gives you something to wipe your nose on. Take this simple test to see if you qualify for solo camping. Shine a flashlight into one ear. If the beam shines out the other ear, do not go into the woods alone. A two+AC0-man pup tent does not include two men or a pup. A potato baked in the coals for one hour makes an excellent side dish. A potato baked in the coals for three hours makes an excellent hockey puck. In emergency situations, you can survive in the wilderness by shooting small game with a slingshot made from the elastic waistband of your underwear.+ACI-

One foryou, one for me.+ACIAIg- He knew what it was. +ACIAIg-Oh, my+ACEAIgAi- he shuddered, +ACIAIg-It's Satan and St. Peter dividing the souls at the cemetery+ACEAIgAi- He cycled down the road as fast as he could and found an old man with a cane, hobbling along. +ACIAIg-Come quick+ACEAIgAi- said the boy. +ACIAIg-You won't believe what I heard. Satan and St. Peter are down at the cemetery dividing the souls.+ACIAIg- The man said, +ACIAIg-Shoo, you brat+ACE- Can't you see I'm finding it hard to walk as it is+ACEAIgAi- After several pleas, the man hobbled to the cemetery.

One for you, one for me...+ACIAIg- The old man whispered, +ACIAIg-Boy, you've been telling the truth+ACE- Let's see if we can see the Devil himself.+ACIAIg- Shivering with fear, they peered through the fence, yet they were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of Satan. At last they heard, +ACIAIg-One for you, one for me. And one last one for you. That's all. Now let's go get those nuts by the fence, and we'll be done.+ACIAIg- They say the old guy made it back to town 5 minutes before the boy.+ACI-
+ACI-Inoculations A client brought a litter of golden retriever puppies to my veterinary clinic for inoculations and worming.

As I sprinkled the last pup's head, the woman leaned forward and whispered, +ACIAIg-I didn't know they had to be baptized, too.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-Top Secret Communications Center When my son was in the Air Force, my wife and I visited quite often. On our first visit, we were allowed inside this top secret Communications Center, but everything in sight was covered up so we could look around everywhere +AC0ALQ- Heck, even the toilet paper in the Men's room was disguised. Anyway, at the exit, there's a sign above the door, which reads: +ACIAIg-You have been exposed to Top Secret Material. Please destroy yourself before leaving the building.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-Science Lesson Miss Jones had been giving her second+AC0-grade students a lesson on science. She had explained about magnets and showed how they would pick up nails and other bits of iron.

+ACI-Locker Combination Another man and I share a locker at work. Noticing that it needed a new combination lock, my partner said he would pick one up on his way to work the next day. It occurred to me later that I might not see him in the morning. How would I find out the combination? I needn't have worried. When I arrived at work I found that he had used the locker before me and had left a note reading: To find the first number subtract 142 from your high score the last time we went bowling. The second number is 16 less than that. To find the third number subtract 1.87 from the amount you owe me.+ACI-
+ACI-The Doily Box As a new bride, Aunt Edna moved into the small home on her husband's ranch near Snowflake. She put a shoe box on a shelf in her closet and asked her husband never to touch it. For fifty years Uncle Jack left the box alone, until Aunt Edna was old and dying. One day when he was putting their affairs in order, he found the box again and thought it might hold something important. Opening it, he found two doilies and +ACQ-82,500 in cash. He took the box to her and asked about the contents. +ACIAIg-My mother gave me that box the day we married,+ACIAIg- she explained. +ACIAIg-She told me to make a doily to help ease my frustrations every time I got mad at you.+ACIAIg- Uncle Jack was very touched that in 50 years she'd only been mad at him twice. +ACIAIg-What's the +ACQ-82,500 for?+ACIAIg- he asked. +ACIAIg-Oh, that's the money I made selling the doilies.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

Watch while I prove it to you.+ACIAIg- The barber puts a dollar bill in one hand and two quarters in the other, then calls the boy over and asks, +ACIAIg-Which do you want, son?+ACIAIg- The boy takes the quarters and leaves. +ACIAIg-What did I tell you?+ACIAIg- said the barber. +ACIAIg-That kid never learns+ACEAIgAi- Later, when the customer leaves, he sees the same young boy coming out of the ice cream store. +ACIAIg-Hey, son+ACE- May I ask you a question?

But you must do one thing before you can enter.+ACIAIg- Very excited, the woman asks what she must do to pass through the gates. +ACIAIg-Spell out a sentence,+ACIAIg- St. Peter replies. +ACIAIg-What sentence?+ACIAIg- she asks. +ACIAIg-Any sentence,+ACIAIg- answers St. Peter. +ACIAIg-It's your choice.+ACIAIg- The woman promptly replies, +ACIAIg-The sentence I will spell is 'love is blind'.

So the woman takes St. Peter's chair and watches the beautiful angels soaring around her, when lo and behold, a man approaches the gates. It is her husband+ACE- +ACIAIg-What happened?+ACIAIg- she cries. +ACIAIg-Why are you here?+ACIAIg- Her husband explains, +ACIAIg-I was so upset when I left your funeral that I got into an automobile accident.

+ACI-Pet Shop Monkeys A tourist walked into a pet shop and was looking at the animals on display. While he was there, another customer walked in and went over to a cage at the side of the shop and took out a monkey. He fit a collar and leash, handed it to the customer, saying, +ACIAIg-That'll be +ACQ-5000.+ACIAIg- The customer paid and walked out with his monkey. Startled, the tourist went over to the shopkeeper and said, +ACIAIg-That was a very expensive monkey. Most of them are only a few hundred dollars. Why did it cost so much?+ACIAIg- The shopkeeper answered, +ACIAIg-Ah, that monkey can program in C +AC0- very fast, tight code, no bugs, well worth the money.+ACIAIg- The tourist looked at the monkey in another cage. +ACIAIg-That one's even more expensive +AC0- +ACQ-10,000+ACE- What does it do?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Oh, that one's a C+//0- monkey+ADs- it can manage object+AC0-oriented programming, Visual C+//0-, even some Java. All the really useful stuff,+ACIAIg- said the shopkeeper. The tourist looked around for a little longer and saw a third monkey in a cage of its own. The price tag around its neck read +ACQ-50,000. He gasped to the shopkeeper, +ACIAIg-That one costs more than all the others put together+ACE- What on earth does it do?+ACIAIg- The shopkeeper replied, +ACIAIg-Well, I haven't actually seen it do anything, but it says it's a consultant.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-Aches and Pains At a nursing home in Florida, a group of senior citizens were sitting around talking about their aches and pains. +ACIAIg-My arms are so weak I can hardly lift this cup of coffee,+ACIAIg- said one. +ACIAIg-I know what you mean. My cataracts are so bad I can't even see my coffee,+ACIAIg- replied another. +ACIAIg-I can't turn my head because of the arthritis in my neck,+ACIAIg- said a third. +ACIAIg-My blood pressure pills make me dizzy,+ACIAIg- another contributed. +ACIAIg-I guess that's the price we pay for getting old,+ACIAIg- winced an old man.

+ACI-The Pretzel Charity A little old lady sold pretzels on a street corner for 25 cents each. Every day a young man would leave his office building at lunch time and, as he passed her pretzel stand, he would leave her a quarter, but would never take a pretzel. This went on for more than five years. The two of them never spoke. One day as the man passed the old lady's pretzel stand and left his quarter as usual, the pretzel woman spoke to him, +ACIAIg-Sir, I appreciate your business. You are a good customer, but I have to tell you that the pretzel price has increased to 35 cents.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-Sure Thing Bar Bet Two guys were in a bar, and they were both watching the television when the news came on. It showed a guy on a bridge who was about to jump, obviously suicidal. +ACIAIg-I'll bet you +ACQ-10 he'll jump,+ACIAIg- said thefirst guy. +ACIAIg-Bet you +ACQ-10 he won't,+ACIAIg- said the second guy. Then, the guy on the television closed his eyes and threw himself off the bridge. The second guy hands the first guy the money. +ACIAIg-I can't take your money,+ACIAIg- said the first guy. +ACIAIg-I cheated you. The same story was on the five o'clock news.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No, no. Take it,+ACIAIg- said the second guy. +ACIAIg-I saw the five o'clock news too. I just didn't think the guy was dumb enough to jump again+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

Q: What's yellow and 1454 feet tall? A: The Empire State Banana.
Q: Where do bees go on their day off? A: To the wax museum.
+ACI-Q: I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this true? A: Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it. Everything wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live longer+ADs- that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it faster. Want to live longer? Take a nap. Q: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables? A: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain? Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100+ACU- of your recommended daily allowance of vegetable slop. Q: Is beer or wine bad for me? A: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables. As we all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories: animal, mineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not animal, and they are not on the periodic table of elements, so that only leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger and a beer and enjoy your liquid vegetables. Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio? A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc. Q: At the gym, a guy asked me to +ACIAIg-spot+ACIAIg- for him while he did the bench press. What did he mean? A: +ACIAIg-Spotting+ACIAIg- for someone means you stand over him while he blows air up your shorts. It's an accepted practice at health clubs+ADs- though if you find that it becomes the ONLY reason why you're going in, you probably ought to reevaluate your exercise program. Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercise program? A: Can't think of a single one, sorry. My philosophy is: No Pain+AC0-No Pain. Q: If I stop smoking, will I live longer? A: Nope. Smoking is a sign of individual expression and peace of mind. If you stop, you'll probably stress yourself to death in record time. Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you? A: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be bad for you? Q: What's the secret to healthy eating? A: Thicker gravy. Q: Will sit+AC0-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the middle? A: Definitely not+ACE- When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You should only be doing sit+AC0-ups if you want a bigger stomach. I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had about trying to live a longer and healthier life...+ACI-

+ACI-After getting all of The Pope's luggage loaded into the limo, (and he doesn't travel light), the driver in New York City notices that the Pope is still standing on the curb. +ACIAIg-Excuse a+AC0-me, Your Holiness,+ACIAIg- says the driver, +ACIAIg-Would you please+AC0-a take+AC0-a your seat so we can+AC0-a leave?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Well, to tell you the truth,+ACIAIg- says the Pope, +ACIAIg-they never let me drive at the Vatican, and I'd really like to drive today.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-I'm+AC0-a sorry but I cannot+AC0-a let you do that. I'd+AC0-a lose+AC0-a my job+ACE- And what if+AC0-a something should+AC0-a happen?+ACIAIg- protests the driver, wishing he'd never gone to work that morning. +ACIAIg-There might be something extra in it for you, +ACIAIg-says the Pope. Reluctantly, the driver gets in the back as the Pope climbs in behind the wheel. The driver quickly regrets his decision when, after exiting the airport, the Pontiff floors it, accelerating the limo to 105 mph. +ACIAIg-Please a+AC0- slow down, Your Holiness+ACEAIQAhACIAIg- pleads the worried driver, but the Pope keeps the pedal to the metal until they hear sirens. +ACIAIg-Oh, dear God, I'm+AC0-a gonna lose a my licence,+ACIAIg- moans the driver. The Pope pulls over and rolls down the window as the cop approaches, but the cop takes one look at him, goes back to his motorcycle, and gets on the radio. +ACIAIg-I need+AC0-a to talk to the Chief,+ACIAIg- he says to the dispatcher. The Chief gets on the radio and the cop tells him that he's stopped a limo going a hundred and five. +ACIAIg-So bust him,+ACIAIg- says the Chief. +ACIAIg-I don't a think we wanna do that, he's a+AC0-really important,+ACIAIg- said the cop. The Chief exclaimed,+ACIAIg- All the more reason+ACEAIgAi- +ACIAIg-No, I mean a really important,+ACIAIg- said the cop.

So, I'm going to throw out Mother Teresa and let in one of the celebrities at the gate. You'll have to go and decide who is most suitable.+ACIAIg- St. Peter goes down to the Pearly Gates and finds Freddie Mercury, Gianni Versace, and Princess Diana waiting for him. He says, +ACIAIg-I'm afraid I can only let one of you in, so each of you must come up with a reason why you should be admitted to Heaven.+ACIAIg- Freddie Mercury says, +ACIAIg-I've been gifted with one of the most beautiful voices to ever grace the earth. I'll spend my time in Heaven singing praises to God with the choirs of angels. Heaven will never have sounded better.+ACIAIg- Gianni Versace says, +ACIAIg-I was Earth's greatest designer. I will outfit the cherubs and angels in all the latest fashions +AC0ALQ- long silky gowns, satin cloaks and nightwear spun from the very clouds we stand on. Heaven will never have looked better.+ACIAIg- Diana blushes a little, looks around nervously and seems unable to find something suitable to say. Suddenly, she strips off her skirt and panties, whips out a bottle of Perrier, shakes it up and douches with it. St. Peter says, +ACIAIg-OK, Diana, you may enter. Have a nice day+ACEAIgAi- Freddie and Gianni are mortified. +ACIAIg-What's going on here?+ACIAIg- Freddie cries. +ACIAIg-We could make heaven look and sound better than ever before, and she performs a disgusting, pornographic act, but she gets in and we don't+ACEAIgAi- St. Peter just shrugs his shoulders and says, +ACIAIg-Sorry, guys, but a royal flush beats a pair of queens any day.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

Marcy confided that there really wasn't anyone special in her life. Heather, on the other hand, was beaming about the new man she had found. +ACIAIg-He's perfect. He's handsome, and last night when we went out to dinner, he said the four little words I've been waiting to hear a man say to me+ACEAIgAi- +ACIAIg-He said 'will you marry me'?+ACIAIg- Marcy asked.

+ACI-Strange Page One of my friends works in the customer service call center of a national pager company. There, he deals with the usual complaints regarding poor pager operation, as well as the occasional crank caller demanding to be paged less often, more often, or by more interesting people. The best call came from Bubba, who repeatedly complained that he keeps being paged by +ACIAIg-Lucille.+ACIAIg- He was instructed that he would have to call her and tell her to stop paging him. +ACIAIg-She don't never leave no number, so I can't call her back,+ACIAIg- he said. After three such calls, someone thought to ask how he knew it was Lucille if she didn't leave a number. +ACIAIg-She leaves her name,+ACIAIg- was the reply. After establishing that the customer had a numeric+AC0-only pager, the light bulb came on. +ACIAIg-How does she spell her name?+ACIAIg- the service rep asked. +ACIAIg-L+AC0-O+AC0-W C+AC0-E+AC0-L+AC0-L+ACIAIg- Another technical problem solved.+ACI-

After she regains her composure she returns and asks again, +ACIAIg-What would you like, sir?+ACIAIg- Again the man thoroughly looks her over and, again, answers, +ACIAIg-A quickie, please.+ACIAIg- This time her anger takes over. She reaches over and slaps him across the face with a resounding +ACIAIg-SMACK+ACEAIgAi- and storms away.

+ACI-How to Survive in the South If you run your car into a ditch, don't panic. Four men in a four wheel drive pickup with a 12 pack of beer and a tow chain will be along shortly. Don't try to help them, just stay out of their way. This is what they live for. Don't be surprised to find movie rentals and bait in the same store. Remember: +ACIAIg-Ya'll+ACIAIg- is singular, +ACIAIg-All ya'll+ACIAIg- is plural, and +ACIAIg-All y'alls'+ACIAIg- is plural possessive. Get used to hearing, +ACIAIg-You ain't from around here, are ya?+ACIAIg- Don't be worried at not understanding what people are saying: they can't understand you either. Be advised that +ACIAIg-He needed killin'+ACIAIg- is a valid defense here. If you hear a southerner exclaim, +ACIAIg-Hey, y'all, watch this,+ACIAIg- stay out of the way. These are likely the last words he'll ever say. Only a Southerner can show or point out to you the general direction of yonder'. Only a Southerner knows exactly how long directly' is, as in: Going to town, be back directly.' Only Southerners grow up knowing the difference between right near' and +ACIAIg-a right far piece.+ACIAIg- They also know that just down the road' can be 1 mile or 20.

+ACI-When I Was Your Age A young man who was also an avid golfer found himself with a few hours to spare one afternoon. He figured if he hurried and played very fast, he could get in 9 holes before he had to head home. Just as he was about to tee off an old gentleman shuffled onto the tee and asked if he could accompany the young man as he was golfing alone. Not being able to say no, he allowed the old gent to join him. To his surprise the old man played fairly quickly. He didn't hit the ball far but plodded along consistently and didn't waste much time. They reached the ninth fairway, and the young man found himself with a tough shot. There was a large pine tree right in front of his ball, directly between his ball and the green. After several minutes of debating how to hit the shot the old man finally said, +ACIAIg-You know, when I was your age I'd hit the ball right over that tree.+ACIAIg- With that challenge placed before him, the youngster swung hard and hit the ball right smack into the top of the tree trunk, where it thudded back on the ground not a foot from where it had originally been. The old man offered one more comment, +ACIAIg-Of course, when I was your age that pine tree was only 3 feet tall.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

His last minute plea for clemency to the governor had failed and he was feeling worn out and depressed. As soon as he walked through the door at home, his wife started on him about, 'What time of night to be getting home is this? Where have you been?' 'Dinner is cold and I'm not reheating it'.

Too shattered to play his usual role in this familiar ritual, he went and poured himself a shot of whiskey and headed off for a long hot soak in the bathtub, pursued by the predictable sarcastic remarks as he dragged himself up the stairs. While he was in the bath, the phone rang. The wife answered and was told that her husband's client, James Wright, had been granted a stay of execution after all. Wright would not be hanged tonight. Finally realizing what a terrible day he must have had, she decided to go upstairs and give him the good news. As she opened the bathroom door, she was greeted by the sight of her husband, bent over naked, drying his legs and feet. 'They're not hanging Wright tonight,' she said.

He was in a six+AC0-man ward rather than a private room, his meals were too cold or not served to suit his taste, the light needed to be adjusted to his demands, the nighttime activities interfered with his rest... and on, and on.

Lo and behold, this horse (a very long shot) won the race. George was most interested to see what the priest did in the next race. Sure enough, he watched the priest step out onto the track as the 5th race horses lined up, and placed his blessing on the forehead of one of the horses.

George began to pull in some serious money and by the last race, he knew his wildest dreams were going to come true. He made a quick stop at the bank and withdrew every penny he owned, and awaited the priest's blessing that would tell him which horse to place the bet on. True to his pattern, the priest stepped out onto the track before the last race and blessed the forehead, eyes, ears and hooves of one of the horses. George placed his bet +AC0ALQ- every cent he owned +AC0ALQ- and watched the horse come in last. George was dumbfounded+ACE- He made his way to the track and when he found the priest, he demanded, +ACIAIg-What happened, Father? All day you blessed horses and they won. The last race, you bless a horse and he loses.

He returned to the aircraft and was less than enthusiastic about what he had to do. Nevertheless, he went about the pumping job deliberately and carefully (and slowly) so as to not risk criticism later. As he's left the plane, the pilot stopped him and said, +ACIAIg-Son, your attitude and performance has caused this flight to be late, and I'm going to personally see to it that you are not just reprimanded, but punished.+ACIAIg- Shivering in the cold, his task finished, the airman took a deep breath, stood up tall and said, +ACIAIg-Sir, with all due respect, I'm not your son+ADs- I'm an Airman in the United States Air Force. I've been in Thule, Greenland for 11 months without any leave, and the reindeer are beginning to look pretty good to me. I have one stripe, it's two+AC0-thirty in the morning, the temperature is 40 degrees below zero and my job here is to pump sh+ACo-t from your aircraft. Now just exactly what form of punishment did you have in mind?+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-One day, there was a catastrophic event that caused all humans on Earth to die. To sort things out, everyone went to Heaven. God came in and said, +ACIAIg-I want the men to make two lines. One line for the men who ruled their women on Earth and the other line for the men who were ruled by their women. Also, I want all the women to go with St. Peter.+ACIAIg- With that, the next time God looked, the women were gone and there were two lines. The line of men who were ruled by their women was 1000 miles long, and in the line of men who ruled their women, there was only one man. God became angry and said, +ACIAIg-You men should be ashamed of yourselves. I created you in my image and you were all whipped by your mates. Look at the only one of my sons who stood up and made me proud. Learn from him+ACE- Tell them, my son, how did you manage to be the only one in this line?+ACIAIg- The man replied, +ACIAIg-I don't know, my wife told me to stand here.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-Five doctors went duck hunting one day. Included in the group were a GP, a pediatrician, a psychiatrist, a surgeon and a pathologist. After a time, a bird came winging overhead. The first to react was the GP who raised his shotgun, but then hesitated. +ACIAIg-I'm not quite sure it's a duck,+ACIAIg- he said, +ACIAIg-I think that I will have to get a second opinion.+ACIAIg- And of course by that time, the bird was long gone. Another bird appeared in the sky thereafter. This time, the pediatrician drew a bead on it. He too, however, was unsure if it was really a duck in his sights and besides, it might have babies. +ACIAIg-I'll have to do some more investigations,+ACIAIg- he muttered, as the creature made good its escape. Next to spy a bird flying was the sharp+AC0-eyed psychiatrist. Shotgun shouldered, he was more certain of his intended prey's identity. +ACIAIg-Now, I know it's a duck, but does it know it's a duck?+ACIAIg- The fortunate bird disappeared while the fellow wrestled with this dilemma. Finally, a fourth fowl sped past and this time the surgeon's weapon pointed skywards.

+ACI-A preacher went to his church office on Monday morning and discovered a dead mule (jackass to the knowing) in the church yard. He called the police. Since there did not appear to be any foul play, the police referred the preacher to the health department. They said since there was no health threat that he should call the sanitation department. The sanitation manager said he could not pick up the mule without authorization from the mayor. Now, the preacher knew the mayor, and was not to eager to call him. The mayor had a bad temper and was generally hard to deal with, but the preacher called him anyway. The mayor did not disappoint. He immediately began to rant and rave at the pastor and finally said, +ACIAIg-Why did you call me anyway?

And the young man did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Siderites, or NERDS for short.

The priest, thinking about what he had said, nudged the man and apologized. +ACIAIg-I'm very sorry, I didn't mean to come on so strong. How long have you had arthritis?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-I don't have it, Father. I was just reading here that the Pope does.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

The man opened up his wallet, displaying a single dollar bill that rested inside. Artie sighed, rolled his eyes, and reluctantly agreed to accept the dollar as down payment for the dirty deed. A few days later, Artie followed the man's wife into the local Safeway grocery store. There he surprised her in the produce department and proceeded to strangle her with his gloved hands.

+ACI-Mind Games for Dogs 1. After your humans give you a bath, DON'T LET THEM TOWEL DRY YOU+ACE- Instead, run to their bed, jump up and dry yourself off on the sheets. This is especially good if it's right before your human's bedtime. 2. Act like a convicted criminal. When the humans come home, put your ears back, tail between your legs, chin down and act as if you have done something really bad. Then, watch as the humans frantically search the house for the damage they think you have caused. (Note: This only works when you have done absolutely nothing wrong.) 3. Let the humans teach you a brand new trick. Learn it perfectly. Then the humans try to demonstrate it to someone else, stare blankly back at the humans. Pretend you have no idea what they're talking about. 4. Draw attention to the human. When out for a walk always pick the busiest, most visible spot to go 'poo'. Take your time and make sure everyone watches. This works particularly well if your humans have forgotten to bring a plastic bag. 5. When out for a walk, alternate between choking and coughing every time a strange human walks by. 6. Make your own rules. Don't always bring back the stick when playing fetch with the humans. Make them go and chase it once in a while. 7. Hide from your humans. When your humans come home, don't greet them at the door. Instead, hide from them, and make them think something terrible has happened to you. (Don't reappear until one of your humans is panic+AC0-stricken and close to tears). 8. When your human calls you to come back in, always take your time. Walk as slowly as possible back to the door.+ACI-

+ACI-Airman Jones was assigned to the induction center where he was to advise new recruits about their government benefits, especially their GI insurance. It wasn't long before Captain Smith noticed that Airman Jones had almost a 100+ACU- record for insurance sales, which had never happened before. Rather than ask about this, the Captain stood in the back of the room and listened to Jones's sales pitch. Jones explained the basics of the GI Insurance to the new recruits, and then said: If you have GI Insurance and go into battle and are killed, the government has to pay +ACQ-200,000 to your beneficiaries. If you don't have GI insurance, and you go into battle and get killed, the government has to pay only a maximum of +ACQ-6000.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Now,+ACIAIg- he concluded, +ACIAIg-Which bunch do you think they are going to send into battle first?+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-One day, when a seamstress was sewing while sitting close to a river, her thimble fell into the river. When she cried out, the Lord appeared and asked, +ACIAIg-My dear child, why are you crying?+ACIAIg- The seamstress replied that her thimble had fallen into the water and that she needed it to help her husband in making a living for their family. The Lord dipped His hand into the water and pulled up a golden thimble set with pearls. +ACIAIg-Is this your thimble?+ACIAIg- the Lord asked. The seamstress replied, +ACIAIg-No.+ACIAIg- The Lord again dipped into the river. He held out a silver thimble ringed with sapphires. +ACIAIg-Is this your thimble?+ACIAIg- the Lord asked. Again, the seamstress replied, +ACIAIg-No.+ACIAIg- The Lord reached down again and came up with a leather thimble. +ACIAIg-Is this your thimble?+ACIAIg- the Lord asked. The seamstress replied, +ACIAIg-Yes.+ACIAIg- The Lord was pleased with the woman's honesty and gave her all three thimbles to keep, and the seamstress went home happy. Some years later, the seamstress was walking with her husband along the riverbank, and her husband fell into the river and disappeared under the water. When she cried out, the Lord again appeared and asked her, +ACIAIg-Why are you crying?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Oh Lord, my husband has fallen into the river+ACEAIgAi- The Lord went down into the water and came up with Mel Gibson. +ACIAIg-Is this your husband?+ACIAIg- the Lord asked. +ACIAIg-Yes,+ACIAIg- cried the seamstress. The Lord was furious. +ACIAIg-You lied+ACE- That is an untruth+ACEAIgAi- The seamstress replied, +ACIAIg-Oh, forgive me, my Lord. It is a misunderstanding. You see, if I had said 'no' to Mel Gibson, you would have come up with Tom Cruise. Then if I said 'no' to him, you would have come up with my husband. Had I then said 'yes,' you would have given me all three. Lord, I'm not in the best of health and would not be able to take care of all three husbands, so THAT'S why I said 'yes' to Mel Gibson.+ACIAIg- MORAL: Whenever a woman lies, it's for a good and honorable reason, and in the best interest of others.+ACI-

+ACI-The Black Canyon Biker A man decided that he was going to ride a 10+AC0-speed bike from Phoenix to Flagstaff. He got as far as Black Canyon City before the mountains just became too much and he could go no farther. He stuck his thumb out, but after 3 hours he hadn't gotten a single person to stop. Finally a guy in a Corvette pulled over and offered him a ride. Of course, the bike wouldn't fit in the car. The owner of the Corvette found a piece of rope lying by the highway and tied it to his bumper. He tied the other end to the bike and told the man that if he got to going too fast to honk the horn on his bike and he would slow down. Everything went fine for the first 30 miles. Suddenly, another Corvette blew past them. Not to be outdone, the Corvette pulling the bike took off after the other. A short distance down the road, the Corvettes+AC0ALQ-both going well over 120 mph+AC0ALQ-blew through a speed trap. The police officer noted the speeds from his radar gun and radioed to the other officer that he had 2 Corvettes headed his way at over 120 mph.

The mechanic straightened up, wiped his hands on a rag and asked, +ACIAIg-So Doc, look at this engine.

+ACI-Beethoven's Ninth The Boston Symphony was performing Beethoven's Ninth. In the piece, there's a long passage about 20 minutes during which the bass violinists have nothing to do.

After slamming several beers in quick succession, one of them looked at his watch. +ACIAIg-Hey+ACE- We need to get back+ACEAIgAi- +ACIAIg-No need to panic,+ACIAIg- said a fellow bassist, +ACIAIg-I thought we might need some extra time, so I tied the last few pages of the conductor's score together with string.

+ACI-King Arthur was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of a neighboring kingdom. The monarch could have killed him but was moved by Arthur's youth and ideals. So, the monarch offered him his freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult question. Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer and, if after a year, he still had no answer+ADs- he would be put to death. The question? . . . What do women really want? Such a question would perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and to young Arthur, it seemed an impossible query. But, since it was better than death, he accepted the monarch's proposition to have an answer by year's end. He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everyone: the princess, the priests, the wise men and even the court jester. He spoke with every one, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. Many people advised him to consult the old witch, for only she would have the answer. But the price would be high+ADs- as the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged. The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no choice but to talk to the witch. She agreed to answer the question, but he would have to agree to her price first. The old witch wanted to marry Sir Lancelot, the most noble of the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend+ACE- Young Arthur was horrified. She was hunchbacked and hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage, made obscene noises, etc. He had never encountered such a repugnant creature in all his life. He refused to force his friend to marry her and endure such a terrible burden+ADs- but Lancelot, learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur. He said nothing was too big of a sacrifice, compared to Arthur's life and the preservation of the Round Table. Hence, a wedding was proclaimed and the witch answered Arthur's question thus: What a woman really wants, she answered . . . is to be in charge of her own life. Everyone in the kingdom instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that Arthur's life would be spared. And so it was, the neighboring monarch granted Arthur his freedom and Lancelot and the witch had a wonderful wedding. The honeymoon hour approached and Lancelot, steeling himself for a horrific experience, entered the bedroom. But, what a sight awaited him. The most beautiful woman he had ever seen lay before him on the bed. The astounded Lancelot asked what had happened The beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her when she appeared as a witch, she would henceforth be her horrible, deformed self only half+AC0-the+AC0-time and the beautiful maiden the other half. Which would he prefer? Beautiful during the day . . . or night? Lancelot pondered the predicament. During the day, a beautiful woman to show off to his friends, but at night, in the privacy of his castle, an old witch? Or, would he prefer having a hideous witch during the day, but by night, a beautiful woman for him to enjoy wondrous intimate moments? What would YOU do? What Lancelot chose is below. BUT . . . make YOUR choice before you scroll down below. OKAY? Noble Lancelot said that he would allow HER to make the choice herself. Upon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time because he had respected her enough to let her be in charge of her own life. Now . . . what is the moral to this story? The moral is . . . If you don't let a woman have her own way . . . Things are going to get ugly+ACE-+ACI-

How about the next one?+ACIAIg- asks St. P eter. +ACIAIg-How many seconds in a year?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Now that one's harder,+ACIAIg- says Forrest, +ACIAIg-but I thunk and thunk about that and I guess the only answer can be twelve.+ACIAIg- Astounded, St. Peter says, +ACIAIg-Twelve? Twelve+ACE-? Forrest, how in Heaven's name could you come up with twelve seconds in a year?+ACIAIg- Forrest says +ACIAIg-Shucks, there's gotta be twelve: January 2nd, February 2nd, March 2nd. . . ....+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Hold it, +ACIAIg- interrupts St. Peter. +ACIAIg-I see where you're going with this, and I see your point, though that wasn't quite what I had in mind..... but I'll have to give you credit for that one, too. Let's go on with the third and final question. Can you tell me God's first name+ACIAIg-? +ACIAIg-Sure+ACIAIg-, Forrest replied, +ACIAIg-its Howard.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Howard?+ACEAIgAi- exclaimed an exasperated and frustrated St. Peter. +ACIAIg-Ok, I can understand how you came up with your answers to my first two questions, but just how in the world did you come up with the name Howard as the first name of God?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Shucks, that was the easiest one of all, +ACIAIg- Forrest replied. +ACIAIg-Don't you know the Our Father? Our father who art in heaven, Howard be thy name. . .+ACIAIg- St. Peter opened the Pearly Gates and said: +ACIAIg-Run Forrest, run.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

(I want to add in a clause here +AC0- This is true, unless she says 'Thanks a lot' +AC0- that is PURE sarcasm and she is not thanking you at all. DO NOT say 'you're welcome' ...

I thought he was on a business trip, but it seems he has run off to Hawaii with his secretary and doesn't intend to come back. He asked me to sell his new Porsche and send him the money.

+ACI-A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, +ACIAIg-My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?+ACIAIg- The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, +ACIAIg-We can't tell you. You're not a monk.+ACIAIg- The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it was, but the monks reply, +ACIAIg-We can't tell you. You're not a monk.+ACIAIg- The man says, +ACIAIg-All right, all right. I'm dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?+ACIAIg- The monks reply, +ACIAIg-You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.+ACIAIg- The man sets about his task. Forty five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, +ACIAIg-I have travelled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.+ACIAIg- The monks reply, +ACIAIg-Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.+ACIAIg- The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, +ACIAIg-The sound is right behind that door.+ACIAIg- The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, +ACIAIg-Real funny. May I have the key?+ACIAIg- The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, +ACIAIg-This is the last key to the last door.+ACIAIg- The man is relieved to no end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound. But I can't tell you what it is, because you're not a monk.+ACI-

+ACI-There was a little boy by the name of Billy. Billy was an ordinary little boy who did ordinary little boy things, like playing, eating, bathing, destroying things, and going to school. One day, when Billy went down to the bus stop to meet the bus to go to school, he found all of his friends huddled around in a little group, talking about the Purple Wombat. Being a little boy, Billy was curious. So he asked them, +ACIAIg-What's the Purple Wombat?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-You don't know what the Purple Wombat is?+ACIAIg- the children exclaimed disgustedly. For the rest of the morning, they would not go near Billy, always standing far away and staring at him. Then the bus came.

He slowly opened the large, heavy door, and timidly entered the room behind it. There, at a large, imposing desk, sat the principal. The principal was a hulking man, balding, with a thin mustache.

He was enough to frighten little boys like Billy who had been sent to his office almost to tears. +ACIAIg-Well, Billy,+ACIAIg- he began slowly. +ACIAIg-What seems to be the problem?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Mr. Principal, I just don't know what's going on today. Everyone's been acting weird, and they're all treating me really badly. Like teacher just sent me to you and stuff.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Now, Billy, I'm here to help you. I'm the princi+AC0-Pal, after all. Heh heh. Can you tell me why everyone's acting so strangely?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-It's because I don't know what some stupid Purple Wombat is.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-What? You don't know what the Purple Wombat is? That's it. I am calling your mother, young man. Consider yourself suspended.+ACIAIg- The principal threw Billy out of his office and told him to go home. Billy, crying, began the long walk home. When he got there, his mother was standing in the doorway waiting for him. +ACIAIg-Billy+ACEAIgAi- she called, sobbing, +ACIAIg-I was so worried about you+ACE- What happened?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Mom,+ACIAIg- Billy cried, +ACIAIg-Everyone was being mean to me and I had to sit in the back of the bus all by myself and the teacher sent me to the principal's office and the principal suspended me, all because I don't know what the Purple Wombat is+ACEAIgAi- +ACIAIg-What? You don't know what the Purple Wombat is?+ACIAIg- Billy's mother shrieked. +ACIAIg-Go to your room this minute. Go+ACE- Just wait until your father gets home+ACEAIgAi- So Billy marched up the stairs and into his room. He collapsed on the bed, crying. After some amount of time, he heard a car pull in and some doors shutting. His father was home. He could hear his parents talking downstairs but didn't know what they were saying. Then he heard footsteps coming up the stairs, and his door opened. +ACIAIg-Billy,+ACIAIg- his father began in that lecturing+AC0-father tone, +ACIAIg-Your mother says you've been acting badly lately. Would you like to tell me what you've done?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Dad, I haven't done anything+ACE- I just don't know what the Purple Wombat is+ACEAIgAi- +ACIAIg-You...don't know what the Purple Wombat is. Well, in that case, you can just stay in this room all night, mister. And forget about dinner+ACEAIgAi- Billy's father slammed the door and stormed off. Billy collapsed on his bed, crying his eyes out. He spent the next several hours that way +AC0ALQ- lying there, crying, wishing he would wake up. Then, in the middle of the night, he heard a voice. It said: +ACIAIg-Billy. I am the Purple Wombat, Billy.+ACIAIg- Billy sat up with a start. He looked around the room, trying to find the source of the voice, but he could not. +ACIAIg-Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Find me, Billy.+ACIAIg- It was coming from out the window. So Billy got up, put his shoes on, opened the window, and climbed out on to the roof. +ACIAIg-Billy. I am the Purple Wombat.+ACIAIg- Billy jumped down off the roof and followed the voice down the road. He got to the edge of a wood. +ACIAIg-Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Follow me, Billy.+ACIAIg- The voice was coming from inside the wood. It was very dark and very frightening, but Billy didn't care. He had to find out what the Purple Wombat was. So, bravely, he entered the wood. +ACIAIg-Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Keep going, Billy.+ACIAIg- Billy kept going into the wood. He could hardly see anything, and he kept falling down and walking into things and hurting himself. But he kept going, driven by a need to find this enigma that kept calling his name. +ACIAIg-Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. This way, Billy.+ACIAIg- Eventually, Billy emerged from the wood. He was on the shore of the town lake. +ACIAIg-Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. I'm out here, Billy.+ACIAIg- It was coming from out across the lake. Billy got one of the small rowboats from the dock, untied it, and rowed out. Since he was only a small boy, it was very difficult. But he had to find out what the Purple Wombat was. +ACIAIg-Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Row, Billy.+ACIAIg- The voice was coming from across the lake. Billy doubled his effort, and the boat began to move a little faster. When he was about half way across the lake, he heard: +ACIAIg-Billy, I am the Purple Wombat. I'm up here, Billy.+ACIAIg- It was coming from directly above him. Billy stopped rowing and stood up to look for it. The boat tipped over, dumping him in the lake. Billy didn't know how to swim, so he drowned.+ACI-

He took her to the police station where she was searched, fingerprinted, photographed, and placed in a holding cell. After a couple of hours, a policeman approached the cell and opened the door. She was escorted back to the booking desk where the arresting officer was waiting with her personal effects. He said, ''I'm very sorry for this mistake. You see, I pulled up behind your car while you were blowing your horn, flipping off the guy in front of you and cussing a blue streak at him. I noticed the 'What Would Jesus Do' bumper sticker, the 'Choose Life' license plate holder, the 'Follow Me to Sunday+AC0-School' bumper sticker, and the chrome+AC0-plated Christian fish emblem on the trunk, so naturally....I assumed you had stolen the car.''+ACI-

+ACI-A Japanese company ( Toyota ) and an American company (General Motors decided to have a canoe race on the Missouri River Both teams practiced long and hard to reach their peak performance before the race. On the big day, the Japanese won by a mile. The Americans, very discouraged and depressed, decided to investigate the reason for the crushing defeat. A management team made up of senior management was formed to investigate and recommend appropriate action. Their conclusion was the Japanese had 8 people rowing and 1 person steering, while the American team had 8 people steering and 1 person rowing. Feeling a deeper study was in order, American management hired a consulting company and paid them a large amount of money for a second opinion. They advised, of course, that too many people were steering the boat, while not enough people were rowing. Not sure of how to utilize that information, but wanting to prevent another loss to the Japanese, the rowing team's management structure was totally reorganized to 4 steering supervisors, 3 area steering superintendents and 1 assistant superintendent steering manager. They also implemented a new performance system that would give the 1 person rowing the boat greater incentive to work harder. It was called the 'Rowing Team Quality First Program,' with meetings, dinners and free pens for the rower. There was discussion of getting new paddles, canoes and other equipment, extra vacation days for practices and bonuses. The next year the Japanese won by two miles. Humiliated, the American management laid off the rower for poor performance, halted development of a new canoe, sold the paddles, and canceled all capital investments for new equipment.

+ACI-Part of rebuilding New Orleans causes residents to often be challenged with the task of tracing home titles back potentially hundreds of years. With a community rich with history stretching back over two centuries, houses have been passed along through generations of family, sometimes making it quite difficult to establish ownership. Here's a great letter an attorney wrote to the FHA on behalf of a client+ADs- You've got to love this lawyer...... A New Orleans lawyer sought an FHA loan for a client. He was told the loan would be granted if he could prove satisfactory title to a parcel of property being offered as collateral. The title to the property dated back to 1803, which took the lawyer three months to track down. After sending the information to the FHA, he received the following reply. (Actual letter): +ACIAIg-Upon review of your letter adjoining your client's loan application, we note that the request is supported by an Abstract of Title. While we compliment the able manner in which you have prepared and presented the application, we must point out that you have only cleared title to the proposed collateral property back to 1803. Before final approval can be accorded, it will be necessary to clear the title back to its origin.+ACIAIg- Annoyed, the lawyer responded as follows (actual letter): +ACIAIg-Your letter regarding title in Case No. 189156 has been received. I note that you wish to have title extended further than the 194 years covered by the present application. I was unaware that any educated person in this country, particularly those working in the property area, would not know that Louisiana was purchased, by the U.S., from France in 1803, the year of origin identified in our application. For the edification of uninformed FHA bureaucrats, the title to the land prior to U.S. ownership was obtained from France , which had acquired it by Right of Conquest from Spain . The land came into the possession of Spain by Right of Discovery made in the year 1492 by a sea captain named Christopher Columbus, who had been granted the privilege of seeking a new route to India by the Spanish monarch, Isabella. The good queen, Isabella, being a pious woman and almost as careful about titles as the FHA, took the precaution of securing the blessing of the Pope before she sold her jewels to finance Columbus ' expedition. Now the Pope, as I'm sure you may know, is the emissary of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and God, it is commonly accepted, created this world Therefore, I believe it is safe to presume that God also made that part of the world called Louisiana . God, therefore, would be the owner of origin and His origins date back, to before the beginning of time, the world as we know it AND the FHA. I hope you find God's original claim to be satisfactory. Now, may we have our loan?+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-A big+AC0-city lawyer was representing the railroad in a lawsuit filed by an old rancher. The rancher's prize bull was missing from the section through which the railroad passed. The rancher claimed that the bull must have been hit by the train, and wanted to be paid the fair value of the bull. The case was scheduled to be tried before the justice of the peace in the back room of the general store. As soon as the rancher showed up, the attorney for the railroad pulled him aside and tried to get him to settle out of court. The lawyer did his best selling job, and finally the rancher agreed to take half of what he was asking. After the rancher had signed the release and took the check, the young lawyer couldn't resist gloating a little over his success, telling the rancher, +ACIAIg-You know, I hate to tell you this, old man, but I put one over on you in there.

+ACI-At New York's Kennedy airport today, an individual later discovered to be a public school teacher was arrested trying to board a flight while in possession of a ruler, a protractor, a setsquare, a slide rule, and a calculator. At a morning press conference, Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez said he believes the man is a member of the notorious al+AC0-Gebra movement. He is being charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math instruction. Al+AC0-Gebra is a fearsome cult,+ACIAIg- Gonzalez said. +ACIAIg-They desire average solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in a search of absolute value. They use secret code names like 'x' and 'y' and refer to themselves as 'unknowns', but we have determined they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country.

The woman looked at herself and she was certainly beautiful. She was surrounded with scads of money in Large Bills. She flung an armful in the air and watched it flutter down around her. She giggled with delight at the mountains of cash. Then she turned to look where her adoring cat once stood. There in the feline's place stood a tall, dark, handsome man with chiseled features, a washboard stomach, broad shoulders, and a soccer+AC0-players+AC0-tush.

+ACI-Child's Perspective on Retirement A teacher asked her young pupils how they spent their vacation. One child wrote the following: We always used to spend the holidays with Grandma and Grandpa. They used to live here in a big brick house, but Grandpa got retarded and they moved to Florida and now they live in a place with a lot of other retarded people. They live in a tin box and have rocks painted green to look like grass. They ride around on big tricycles and wear nametags because they don't know who they are anymore. They go to a building called a wrecked center, but they must have got it fixed, because it is all right now. They play games and do exercises there, but they don't do them very well. There is a swimming pool, too, but they all jump up and down in it with their hats on. I guess they don't know how to swim. At their gate, there is a dollhouse with a little old man sitting in it. He watches all day so nobody can escape. Sometimes they sneak out. Then they go cruising in their golf carts. My Grandma used to bake cookies and stuff, but I guess she forgot how. Nobody there cooks, they just eat out. And they eat the same thing every night: Early Birds. Some of the people can't get past the man in the dollhouse to go out. So the ones who do get out bring food back to the wrecked center and call it potluck. My Grandma says Grandpa worked all his life to earn his retardment and says I should work hard so I can be retarded some day, too. When I earn my retardment I want to be the man in the doll house. Then I will let people out so they can visit their grandchildren.+ACI-
+ACI-The Judge's Tie At a clearance sale, the wife of a federal district court judge found a green tie that was a perfect match for one of her husband's sports jackets. Soon after, while the couple was vacationing at a resort complex to get his mind off a rather complicated cocaine conspiracy case, he noticed a small, round disc sewn into the design of the tie. The judge showed it to a local FBI agent, who was equally suspicious that it might be a 'bug' planted by the conspiracy defendants.

+ACI-The townspeople did a little research and discovered they could get a cow from Moscow for 2000 rubles +AC0- or one from Minsk for only 1000 rubles. So, naturally, they got the cow from Minsk. It was a great cow had a wonderful disposition, and gave lots of milk and lots of cream. Everybody loved it dearly. The people decided they would mate the cow and get more cows like it, and then they would never have to worry about their milk supply again. So they got a bull and led the cow and the bull into the pasture. When the bull came in from the right to mount the cow, the cow moved to the left. When the bull moved in to mount the cow from the left, the cow moved to the right. This went on all day. Finally, in desperation, the people decided to go ask the rabbi what to do. After all he was very wise. They told him the story. +ACIAIg-Rabbi, we've tried all day to mate our cow. When the bull moves in from the right the cow moves left and when the bull moves in from the left the cow moves to the right. What do we do?+ACIAIg- The Rabbi thought a moment and asked, +ACIAIg-Did you buy this cow from Minsk?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Rabbi+ACEAIgAi- they replied as one, +ACIAIg-You are so wise+ACE- We never said we bought the cow from Minsk. How did you know that?+ACIAIg- The Rabbi said, sadly, +ACIAIg-My wife is from Minsk.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-There were two lovers, who were really into spiritualism and reincarnation.

Unfortunately, a few weeks later, the young man died in a car wreck. True to her word, his sweetheart tried to contact him in the spirit world exactly 30 days later. At the seance, she called out, +ACIAIg-John, John, this is Martha. Do you hear me?+ACIAIg- A ghostly voice answered her, +ACIAIg-Yes Martha, this is John. I can hear you.+ACIAIg- Martha tearfully asked, +ACIAIg-Oh John, what is it like where you are?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-It's beautiful. There are azure skies, a soft breeze, sunshine most of the time.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-What do you do all day?+ACIAIg- asked Martha. +ACIAIg-Well, Martha, we get up before sunrise, eat some good breakfast, and there's nothing but making love until noon. After lunch, we nap until two and then make love again until about five. After dinner, we go at it again until we fall asleep about 11 p.m.+ACIAIg- Martha was somewhat taken aback. +ACIAIg-Is that what heaven really is like?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Heaven? I'm not in heaven, Martha.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Well, then, where are you?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-I'm a rabbit in Arizona.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-The Americans and Russians at the height of the arms race realized that if they continued in the usual manner they were going to blow up the whole world. One day they sat down and decided to settle the whole dispute with one dog fight. They would have five years to breed the best fighting dog in the world and which ever side's dog won would be entitled to dominate the world. The losing side would have to lay down its arms. The Russians found the biggest meanest Doberman and Rottweiler females in the world and bred them with the biggest meanest Siberian wolves. They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from each litter, killed his siblings, and gave him all the milk. They used steroids and trainers and after five years came up with the biggest meanest dog the world had ever seen. Its cage needed steel bars that were five inches thick and nobody could get near it. When the day came for the dog fight, the Americans showed up with a strange animal. It was a nine foot long Dachshund. Everyone felt sorry for the Americans because they knew there was no way that this dog could possibly last ten seconds with the Russian dog. When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund came out of it's cage and slowly waddled over towards the Russian dog. The Russian dog snarled and leaped out of it's cage and charged the American dachshund. But, when it got close enough to bite the Dachshund's neck, the Dachshund opened it's mouth and consumed the Russian dog in one bite. There was nothing left at all of the Russian dog. The Russians came up to the Americans shaking their heads in disbelief. +ACIAIg-We don't understand how this could have happened. We had our best people working for five years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler females in the world and the biggest meanest Siberian wolves.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-That's nothing+ACIAIg-, an American replied. +ACIAIg-We had our best plastic surgeons working for five years to make an alligator look like a Dachshund.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-A motorcycle patrolman was rushed to the hospital with an inflamed appendix. The doctors operated and advised him that all was well. However, the patrolman kept feeling something pulling at the hairs in his crotch. Worried that it might be a second surgery the doctors hadn't told him about, he finally got enough energy to pull his hospital gown up enough so he could look at what was making him so uncomfortable. Taped firmly across his pubic hair were three wide strips of adhesive tape, the kind that doesn't come off easily. Written in large black letters was the sentence. +ACIAIg-Get well soon.....From the nurse you gave a ticket to last week.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

He calls the number, and the gorilla remover says he'll be over in 30 minutes. The gorilla remover arrives, and gets out of his van. He's got a ladder, a baseball bat, a shotgun and a mean old pit bull. +ACIAIg-What are you going to do?+ACIAIg- the homeowner asks. +ACIAIg-I'm going to put this ladder up against the roof, then I'm going to go up there and knock the gorilla off the roof with this baseball bat. When the gorilla falls off, the pit bull is trained to grab his testicles and not let go. The gorilla will then be subdued enough for me to put him in the cage in the back of the van.+ACIAIg- So the guy puts the ladder up, gets the bat and the shotgun and walks towards the ladder. As he gets to the base of the ladder, he hands the shotgun to the homeowner. +ACIAIg-What's the shotgun for?+ACIAIg- asks the homeowner. +ACIAIg-If the gorilla knocks me off the roof, shoot the damn dog+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

On the way home he stopped at the hardware store and bought a bucket and an anvil. He stopped at the feed store / livestock dealer and picked up a couple of chickens and a goose. However, he had a problem... How to carry his entire purchases home. The feed store owner said, +ACIAIg-Why don't you put the anvil in the bucket, carry the bucket in one hand, put a chicken under each arm and carry the goose in your other hand?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Hey, thanks+ACEAIgAi- said the biker, and out the door he went.

The biker said, as a matter of fact, I live at 1616 Mockingbird Lane.+ACIAIg- We can take a short cut down this alley and be there in no time+ACIAIg-. The little old lady looked him over cautiously, and then said, +ACIAIg-I am a lonely widow without a husband to defend me. How do I know that when we get in the alley you won't hold me up against the wall, pull up my skirt, and ravish me?+ACIAIg- The biker said, +ACIAIg-Holy smokes lady+ACE- I'm carrying a bucket, an anvil, two chickens, and a goose.

Finally I thought of a clever way to make the point. When my husband arrived home that day, he found me seated in the tall grass, busily snipping away with a tiny pair of sewing scissors. He watched silently for a short time and then went into the house. He was gone only a few moments when he came out again. He handed me a toothbrush. +ACIAIg-When you finish cutting the grass,+ACIAIg- he said, +ACIAIg-you might as well sweep the sidewalks.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-An older couple had a son, who was still living with his parents. The parents were a little worried, as the son was still unable to decide about his career path... so they decided to do a small test. They took a ten+AC0-dollar bill, a Bible, and a bottle of whiskey, and put them on the front hall table. Then they hid, hoping he would think they weren't at home. The father told the mother, +ACIAIg-If he takes the money he will be a businessman, if he takes the Bible he will be a priest +AC0- but if he takes the bottle of whiskey, I'm afraid our son will be a drunkard.+ACIAIg- So the parents took their place in the nearby closet and waited nervously. Peeping through the keyhole they saw their son arrive home. He saw the note they had left, saying they'd be home later. Then, he took the 10+AC0-dollar bill, looked at it against the light, and slid it in his pocket. After that, he took the Bible, flicked through it, and took it also. Finally, he grabbed the bottle, opened it, and took an appreciative whiff to be assured of the quality. Then he left for his room, carrying all the three items. The father slapped his forehead, and said: +ACIAIg-Darn, it's even worse than I ever imagined...+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-What do you mean?+ACIAIg- his wife inquired. +ACIAIg-Our son is going to be a politician+ACEAIgAi- replied the concerned father.+ACI-

+ACI-A wife and her husband were having a dinner party for all the major status figures in Rome, Italy. The wife was very excited about this and wanted everything to be perfect. At the very last minute, she realized that she didn't have any snails for this dinner party, so she asked her husband to run down to the beach with the bucket she was handing him to gather some snails.

+ACI-A plane was taking off from Kennedy Airport. After it reached a comfortable cruising altitude, the captain made an announcement over the intercom, +ACIAIg-Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Welcome to Flight Number 293, nonstop from New York to Los Angeles. The weather ahead is good and therefore we should have a smooth and uneventful flight. Now sit back and relax+AC0ALQAt-OH MY...+ACEAIgAi- Then silence.

+ACI-A tourist wanders into a back+AC0-alley antique shop somewhere in Washington DC. Picking through the objects on display he discovers a detailed, life+AC0-sized bronze sculpture of a rat. The sculpture is so interesting and unique that he picks it up and asks the shop owner what it costs. +ACIAIg-Twelve dollars for the rat, sir,+ACIAIg- says the shop owner, +ACIAIg-and a thousand dollars more for the story behind it.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-You can keep the story, old man,+ACIAIg- he replies, +ACIAIg-but I'll take the rat.+ACIAIg- The transaction complete, the tourist leaves the store with the bronze rat under his arm. As he crosses the street in front of the store,two live rats emerge from a sewer drain and fall into step behind him. Nervously looking over his shoulder, he begins to walk faster, but every time he passes another sewer drain, more rats come out and follow him. By the time he's walked two blocks, at least a hundred rats are at his heels, and people begin to point and shout. He walks even faster, and soon breaks into a trot as multitudes of rats swarm from sewers, basements, vacant lots, and abandoned cars. Rats by the thousands are at his heels, and as he sees the waterfront at the bottom of the hill, he panics and starts to run full tilt. No matter how fast he runs, the rats keep up, squealing hideously, now not just thousands but millions, so that by the time he comes rushing up to the water's edge a trail of rats twelve city blocks long is behind him. Making a mighty leap, he jumps up onto a light post, grasping it with one arm while he hurls the bronze rat into the Potomac Tidal Basin with the other, as far as he can heave it. Pulling his legs up and clinging to the light post, he watches in amazement as the seething tide of rats surges over the breakwater into the Basin, where they drown. Shaken and mumbling, he makes his way back to the antique shop.+ACIAIg-So, you've come back for the rest of the story,+ACIAIg- says the owner. +ACIAIg-No,+ACIAIg- says the tourist, +ACIAIg-I was wondering if you have a bronze congressman. +ACIAIg-+ACI-

The man again pours the drink down his throat and bam, the boy grows an arm. The people at the bar are so amazed by this they keep on buying the boy a drink until finally he has a full body. +ACIAIg-Right dad, I've had enough, meet you back home.+ACIAIg- At this the boy opened the door, stepped outside and got run over by a bus. The barman is distraught, +ACIAIg-I am so sorry, if I knew that was going to happen I would have never bought him that drink. +ACIAIg-Don't worry,+ACIAIg- the man said +ACIAIg-he should of quit while he was ahead.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-Thought you might enjoy this message I received from one of my more politically oriented friends..... . OUR NATIONAL PRIDE+ACE- As we all know, the Taliban considers it a sin for a man to see a naked woman who is not his wife. So, this Saturday at 2:00 PM (ET) all American women are asked to walk out of their house completely naked to help weed out any neighborhood terrorists. Circling your block for one hour is recommended for this anti+AC0-terrorist effort. All men are to position themselves in Yard chairs in front of their house to prove they are not Taliban, demonstrate that they think it's okay to see nude women other than their wife and to show support for all American women. And since the Taliban also does not approve of alcohol, a cold six+AC0-pack at your side is further proof of your anti+AC0-Taliban sentiment. The American Government appreciates your efforts to root out terrorists and applauds your participation in this anti+AC0-terrorist activity. God Bless America+ACE-+ACI-
+ACI-In Florida, an atheist became incensed over the preparation for Easter and Passover holidays and decided to contact the local ACLU about the discrimination inflicted on atheists by the constant celebrations afforded to Christians and Jews with all their holidays while the atheists had no holiday to celebrate. The ACLU jumped on the opportunity to once again pick up the cause of the godless and assigned their sharpest attorneys to the case.

As he walked down the street he realized he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life.

How did you know?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Been in the business 60 years.+ACIAIg- Joe tried on the shoes and they also fit perfectly.

+ACI-In light of the rising frequency of human +AC0- grizzly bear conflicts, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game is advising hikers, hunters, and fishermen to take extra precautions and keep alert of bears while in the field. They advise that outdoorsmen wear noisy little bells on their clothing so as not to startle bears that aren't expecting them. They also advise outdoorsmen to carry pepper spray with them in case of an encounter with a bear. It is also a good idea to watch out for fresh signs of bear activity. Outdoorsmen should recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear dung. Black bear dung is smaller and contains lots of berries and squirrel fur.

I tried a new recipe. It said prepare ingredients, lay on a bed of lettuce one hour before serving. Tom asked me why I was rolling around in the garden. FRIDAY: I found an easy recipe for cookies. It said put the ingredients in a bowl and beat it. There must have been something wrong with this recipe. When I got back, everything was the same as when I left. SATURDAY: Tom did the shopping today and brought home a chicken. He asked me to dress it for Sunday (oh boy).For some reason Tom keeps counting to ten. SUNDAY: Tom's folks came to dinner. I wanted to serve roast but all I had was hamburger. Suddenly I had a flash of genius. I put the hamburger in the oven and set the controls for roast. It still came out hamburger, much to my disappointment. GOOD NIGHT DEAR DIARY. This has been a very exciting week. I am eager for tomorrow to come so I can try out a new recipe on Tom. If I can talk Tom into buying a bigger oven, I would like to surprise him with chocolate moose.+ACI-

+ACI-A woman meets a gorgeous man in a bar. They talk, they connect, they end up leaving together. They go back to his place, and as he shows her around his apartment, she notices that his bedroom is completely packed with sweet cuddly teddy bears.

After they crawl out of their cars, the woman says, +ACIAIg-So you're a man, that's interesting. I'm a woman. Wow, just look at our cars+ACE- There's nothing left, but fortunately we are unhurt.

+ACI-A very religious man lived right next door to an atheist. While the religious one prayed day in, day out, and was constantly on his knees in communion with his Lord, the atheist never even looked twice at a church. However, the atheist's life was good, he had a well+AC0-paying job and a beautiful wife, and his children were healthy and good+AC0-natured, whereas the pious man's job was strenuous and his wages were low, his wife was cheating on him and his kids wouldn't give him the time of the day. So one day, deep in prayer as usual, he raised his eyes towards heaven and asked: +ACIAIg-Oh God, I honor you every day, I ask your advice for every problem and confess to you my every sin. Yet my neighbour, who doesn't even believe in you and certainly never prays, seems blessed with every happiness, while I go poor and suffer many an indignity. Why is this?+ACIAIg- And a great voice was heard from above ... +ACIAIg-BECAUSE HE DOESN'T BOTHER ME ALL THE TIME.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-An elderly lady finished her shopping and, upon return to the parking lot, found four men in her car. She dropped her shopping bags and drew her handgun, screaming at the top of her voice that she knew how to use it and that she would if required, so they should get out of the car. The four men didn't wait around for a second invitation, but got out and ran like mad, whereupon the lady loaded her shopping bags into the back of the car and got into the driver's seat. Small problem +AC0ALQ- her key wouldn't fit the ignition. Her car, identical to the one she was in, was parked four or five spaces farther down. She loaded her bags into her own car and drove to the police station. The officer to whom she told the story nearly tore himself in two with laughter and pointed to the far end of the counter, where four men were reporting a carjacking by a mad elderly woman. No charges were filed.+ACI-

Hmmm,+ACIAIg- the father says. +ACIAIg-Admirable, but what will you do to provide a nice house for my daughter to live in, as she's accustomed to?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-I will study,+ACIAIg- the young man replies, +ACIAIg-and God will provide for us.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-And how will you buy her a beautiful engagement ring, such as she deserves?+ACIAIg- asks the father. +ACIAIg-I will concentrate on my studies,+ACIAIg- the young man replies, +ACIAIg-God will provide for us.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-And children?+ACIAIg- asks the father. +ACIAIg-How will you support children?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Don't worry, sir, God will provide,+ACIAIg- replies the fiancee. The conversation proceeds like this, and each time the father questions, the young idealist insists that God will provide. Later, the mother asks, +ACIAIg-How did it go, Honey?+ACIAIg- The father answers, +ACIAIg-He has no job and no plans, but the good news is he thinks I'm God.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

I would recommend it very highly.+ACIAIg- The other man said, +ACIAIg-What is the name of the restaurant?+ACIAIg- The first man thought and thought and finally said, +ACIAIg-What is the name of that flower you give to someone you love? You know... the one that's red and has thorns.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Do you mean a rose?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Yes, that's the one,+ACIAIg- replied the man.

+ACI-The only cow in a small Kentucky town stopped giving milk. The people did some research and found that they could buy a cow just across the state line in Illinois for +ACQ-200. They brought the cow from Illinois and the cow was wonderful. It produced lots of milk all of the time, and the people were very happy. They decided to acquire a bull to mate with the cow to produce more cows like it. They would never have to worry about their milk supply again. They bought the bull and put it in the pasture with their beloved cow. However, whenever the bull tried to mount the cow, the cow would move away. No matter what approach the bull tried, the cow would move away from the bull and he could not succeed in his quest. The people were very upset and decided to ask the Vet, who was very wise, what to do. They told the Vet what was happening. +ACIAIg-Whenever the bull tries to mount our cow, she moves away. If he approaches from the back, she moves forward. When he approaches her from the front, she backs off. An attempt from the side, she walks away to the other side.+ACIAIg- The Vet thought about this for a minute and asked, +ACIAIg-Did you by chance, buy this cow in Illinois?+ACIAIg- The people were dumbfounded, since no one had ever mentioned where they bought the cow. +ACIAIg-You are truly a wise Vet,+ACIAIg- they said. +ACIAIg-How did you know we got the cow in Illinois?+ACIAIg- The Vet replied with a distant look in his eye, +ACIAIg-My wife is from Illinois.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

Then management said, +ACIAIg-How will we know the night watchman is doing his tasks correctly?+ACIAIg- So they created a Quality Control department and hired two people. One to do the studies and one to write the reports. Then management said, +ACIAIg-How are these people going to get paid?+ACIAIg- So they created the following positions, a timekeeper and a payroll officer+ADs- then hired two more people. Then management said, +ACIAIg-Who will be accountable for all of these people?+ACIAIg- So they created an administrative section and hired three people+ADs- an Administrative Officer, Assistant Administrative Officer, and a Legal Secretary. Then management said, +ACIAIg-We've had this command in operation for one year now and we're +ACQ-18,000 over budget.

+ACI-At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated: +ACIAIg-If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving twenty+AC0-five dollar cars that got 1000 miles to the gallon.+ACIAIg- In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating: If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics: 1. For no reason whatsoever your car would crash twice a day. 2. Every time they repainted the lines on the road you would have tobuy a new car. 3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason, andyou would just accept this, restart and drive on. 4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn, would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine. 5. Only one person at a time could use the car, unless you bought +ACIAIg-Car95+ACIAIg- or +ACIAIg-CarNT.+ACIAIg- But then you would have to buy more seats. 6. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, reliable, five times as fast, and twice as easy to drive, but would only run on five per cent of the roads. 7. The oil, water temperature and alternator warning lights would be replaced by a single +ACIAIg-general car default+ACIAIg- warning light. 8. New seats would force everyone to have the same size butt. 9. The airbag system would say +ACIAIg-Are you sure?+ACIAIg- before going off. 10. Occasionally for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key, and grab hold of the radio antenna. 11. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even though they neither need them nor want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the car's performance to diminish by 50+ACU- or more. Moreover, GM would become a target for investigation by the Justice Department. 12. Every time GM introduced a new model car buyers would have to learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car. 13. You'd press the +ACIAIg-start+ACIAIg- button to shut off the engine.+ACI-
+ACI-Three bulls heard via the grapevine that the rancher was going to bring another bull onto the ranch, and the prospect raised a discussion among them. The first bull says, +ACIAIg-Boys, we all know I've been here 5 years. Once we settled our differences, we agreed on which 100 of the cows would be mine. Now, I don't know where this newcomer is going to get HIS cows, but I ain't' givin' him any of mine.+ACIAIg- The second bull says, +ACIAIg-That pretty much says it for me, too.

I think I can spare a few for our new friend.+ACIAIg- The second bull says, +ACIAIg-I'll have plenty of cows to take care of if I just stay on the opposite end of the pasture from HIM. I'm certainly not looking for an argument.+ACIAIg- They look over at their young friend, the third bull, and find him pawing the dirt, shaking his horns, and snorting up a storm. The first bull says, +ACIAIg-Son, let me give you some advice real quick. Let him have some of your cows and live to tell about it.+ACIAIg- The third bull says, +ACIAIg-Heck, he can have ALL my cows. I'm just making sure he knows I'M a bull+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

+ACI-Annoyed by the professor of anatomy who liked to tell +ACIAIg-naughty+ACIAIg- stories during class, a group of female students decided that the next time he started to tell one, they would all rise and leave the room in protest.

The sergeant gave the typed copy only a brief glance. +ACIAIg-That's fine,+ACIAIg- he said. +ACIAIg-Report for work at 8tomorrow.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-But aren't you going to check the test?+ACIAIg- the prospective clerk asked.

To the surprise of the boss, the small voice whispered, +ACIAIg-No.+ACIAIg- Wanting to talk with an adult, the boss asked, +ACIAIg-Is your Mommy there?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Yes,+ACIAIg- came the answer. +ACIAIg-May I talk with her?+ACIAIg- Again the small voice whispered, +ACIAIg-No.+ACIAIg- Knowing that it was not likely that a young child would be left home alone, the boss decided he would just leave a message with the person who should be there watching over the child. +ACIAIg-Is there any one there besides you?+ACIAIg- the boss asked the child. +ACIAIg-Yes+ACIAIg- whispered the child, +ACIAIg-A policeman.+ACIAIg- Wondering what a cop would be doing at his employee's home, the boss asked, +ACIAIg-May I speak with the policeman?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No, he's busy,+ACIAIg- whispered the child. +ACIAIg-Busy doing what?+ACIAIg- asked the boss. +ACIAIg-Talking to Daddy and Mommy and the Fireman,+ACIAIg- came the whispered answer. Growing concerned and even worried as he heard what sounded like a helicopter through the ear piece on the phone the boss asked, +ACIAIg-What is that noise?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-A hello+AC0-copper,+ACIAIg- answered the whispering voice. +ACIAIg-What is going on there?+ACIAIg- asked the boss, now alarmed. In an awed whispering voice the child answered, +ACIAIg-The search team just landed the hello+AC0-copper.+ACIAIg- Alarmed, concerned and more than just a little frustrated the boss asked, +ACIAIg-Why are they there?+ACIAIg- Still whispering, the young voice replied along with a muffled giggle: +ACIAIg-They're looking for me+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

+ACI-Over breakfast one morning, a woman said to her husband, +ACIAIg-I bet you don't know what day this is.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Of course I do,+ACIAIg- he indignantly answered, going out the door to the office. At 10 AM, the doorbell rang and when the woman opened the door, she was handed a box containing a dozen long stemmed red roses. At 1 PM, a foil wrapped, two pound box of her favorite chocolates arrived. Later, a boutique delivered a designer dress. The woman couldn't wait for her husband to come home. +ACIAIg-First the flowers, then the chocolates and then the dress+ACEAIgAi- she exclaimed. +ACIAIg-I've never had a more wonderful Groundhog Day in my life+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

+ACI-A man decides he wants to have a pig roast, so he goes out to a pig farm to buy one. He agrees on a per pound price with the farmer and then begins to select a pig. +ACIAIg-How about that one?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-OK,+ACIAIg- replies the farmer. The farmer then picks up the pig, puts it's tail in his mouth, lets it hang from his mouth and then declares, +ACIAIg-This one weighs 74 pounds.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-That's amazing,+ACIAIg- the man says, +ACIAIg-Are you sure you can tell a pigs' weight by using that method?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Yep, says the farmer, we've used this method in our family for generations.+ACIAIg- To prove his accuracy, the farmer puts the pig on a scale and it weighs exactly 74 pounds. +ACIAIg-My son can do it, too,+ACIAIg- boasts the farmer. Sure enough, the farmer's son comes over, puts another pigs' tail in his mouth, lets it hang and then says, +ACIAIg-This one weighs 83 pounds.+ACIAIg- The farmer then confirms his sons' accuracy with the scale. +ACIAIg-My wife can do it, too,+ACIAIg- says the farmer. +ACIAIg-Son, go get your mother.+ACIAIg- The boy runs off to the house and returns a few minutes later. +ACIAIg-Mom can't come out right now,+ACIAIg- says the son. +ACIAIg-She's busy weighing the mailman.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-The four Goldberg brothers, Lowell, Norman, Hiram, and Max, invented and developed the first automobile air+AC0-conditioner. On July 17, 1946, the temperature in Detroit was 97 degrees. The four brothers walked into Henry Ford's office and sweet+AC0-talked his secretary into telling him that four gentlemen were there with the most exciting innovation in the auto industry since the electric starter. Henry was curious and invited them into his office. They refused and instead asked that he come out to the parking lot to their car. They persuaded him to get into the car, which was about 130 degrees, turned on the air conditioner, and cooled the car off immediately. Henry got very excited and invited them back to the office, where he offered them +ACQ-3 million for the patent. The brothers refused, saying they would settle for +ACQ-2 million, but they wanted the recognition by having a label, 'The Goldberg Air+AC0-Conditioner,' on the dashboard of each car in which it was installed. Now Henry Ford was more than just a little anti+AC0-Semitic, and there was no way he was going to put the Goldberg's name on two million Fords. They haggled back and forth for about two hours and finally agreed on +ACQ-4 million and that just their first names would be shown. And so to this day, all Ford air conditioners show: Lo, Norm, Hi, and Max on the controls. So, now you know...+ACI-
+ACI-In California Unleaded gas went to +ACQ-4.00 a gallon last Thursday. Sister Mary Ann, who worked for a home health agency, was out making her rounds visiting homebound patients when she ran out of gas. Fortunately, an Exxon station was just a block away. She walked to the station to borrow a gas can and buy some gas. The attendant told her that the only gas can he owned had been loaned out, but she could wait until it was returned. Since Sister Mary Ann was on the way to see a patient, she decided not to wait, and walked back to her car. She looked for something in her car that she could fill with gas, and spotted the bedpan she was taking to the patient. Always resourceful, Sister Mary Ann carried the bedpan to the station, filled it with gasoline, and carried the full bedpan back to her car. As she was pouring the gas into her tank, two Baptist ladies watched from across the street. One of them turned to the other and said, 'If it starts, I'm turning Catholic.'+ACI-

+ACI-How to Mess Up a Job Interview We've all been interviewed for jobs. And, we've all spent most of those interviews thinking about what not to do. Don't bite your nails. Don't fidget. Don't interrupt. Don't belch. If we did any of the don'ts, we knew we'd disqualify ourselves instantly. But some job applicants go light years beyond this. We surveyed top personnel executives of 100 major American corporations and asked for stories of unusual behavior by job applicants. The lowlights: +AC0- +ACIAIg-...stretched out on the floor to fill out the job application.+ACIAIg- +AC0- +ACIAIg-She wore a Walkman and said she could listen to me and the music at the same time.+ACIAIg- +AC0- +ACIAIg-A balding candidate abruptly excused himself. Returned to office a few minutes later, wearing a hairpiece.+ACIAIg- +AC0- +ACIAIg-...asked to see interviewer's resume to see if the personnel executive was qualified to judge the candidate.+ACIAIg- +AC0- +ACIAIg-... announced she hadn't had lunch and proceeded to eat a hamburger and french fries in the interviewer's office +AC0- wiping the ketchup on her sleeve.+ACIAIg- +AC0- +ACIAIg-Stated that, if he were hired, he would demonstrate his loyalty by having the corporate logo tattooed on his forearm.+ACIAIg- +AC0- +ACIAIg-Interrupted to phone his therapist for advice on answering specific interview questions.+ACIAIg- +AC0- +ACIAIg-When I asked him about his hobbies, he stood up and started tap dancing around my office.+ACIAIg- +AC0- +ACIAIg-At the end of the interview, while I stood there dumbstruck, went through my purse, took out a brush, brushed his hair, and left.+ACIAIg- +AC0- +ACIAIg-...pulled out a Polaroid camera and snapped a flash picture of me. Said he collected photos of everyone who interviewed him.+ACIAIg- +AC0- +ACIAIg-Said he wasn't interested because the position paid too much.+ACIAIg- +AC0- +ACIAIg-While I was on a long+AC0-distance phone call, the applicant took out a copy of Penthouse, and looked through the photos only, stopping longest at the centerfold.+ACIAIg- +AC0- +ACIAIg-During the interview, an alarm clock went off from the candidate's brief case. He took it out, shut it off, apologized and said he had to leave for another interview.+ACIAIg- +AC0- +ACIAIg-A telephone call came in for the job applicant. It was from his wife. His side of the conversation went like this: 'Which company? When do I start? What's the salary?' I said, 'I assume you're not interested in conducting the interview any further.' He promptly responded, 'I am as long as you'll pay me more.' I didn't hire him, but later found out there was no other job offer. It was a scam to get a higher offer.+ACIAIg- +AC0- +ACIAIg-His attache +AFs-case+AF0- opened when he picked it up and the contents spilled, revealing ladies' undergarments and assorted makeup and perfume.+ACIAIg- +AC0- +ACIAIg-Candidate said he really didn't want to get a job, but the unemployment office needed proof that he was looking for one.+ACIAIg- +AC0- +ACIAIg-...asked who the lovely babe was, pointing to the picture on my desk. When I said it was my wife, he asked if she was home now and wanted my phone number. I called security.+ACIAIg- +AC0- +ACIAIg-Pointing to a black case he carried into my office, he said that if he was not hired, the bomb would go off. Disbelieving, I began to state why he would never be hired and that I was going to call the police. He then reached down to the case, flipped a switch, and ran. No one was injured, but I did need to get a new desk.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-A drunk that smelled like a brewery got on a bus one day. He sat down next to a priest. The drunk's shirt was stained, his face was full of bright red lipstick, and he had a half empty bottle of wine sticking out of his pocket. He opened his newspaper and started reading. A couple of minutes later, he asked the priest, +ACIAIg-Father, what causes arthritis+ACIAIg-? +ACIAIg-Mister, it's caused by loose living, being with cheap, wicked women, too much alcohol, and contempt for your fellow man. +ACIAIg-Well, I'll be damned,+ACIAIg- the drunk muttered and returned to reading his paper. The priest, thinking about what he said, turned to the man and apologized. +ACIAIg-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to come on so strong. How long have you had arthritis?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-I don't have arthritis, Father, but I just read in the paper that the Pope has it.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

Perhaps you would prefer someone else,+ACIAIg- said the madam. +ACIAIg-No, I must see Valerie,+ACIAIg- was the man's reply. Just then, Valerie appeared and announced to the man that she charged +ACQ-1,000 a visit. Without hesitation, the man pulled out ten one+AC0-hundred dollar bills, gave them to Valerie, and they went upstairs. After an hour, the man calmly left. The next night, the same man appeared again, demanding to see Valerie. Valerie explained that none had ever come back two nights in a row+AC0ALQ-too expensive+AC0ALQ-and there were no discounts. The price was still +ACQ-1,000. Again the man pulled out the money, gave it to Valerie and they went upstairs. After an hour, he left. The following night the man was there again. Everyone was astounded that he had come for the third consecutive night, but he paid Valerie and they went upstairs. After their session, Valerie questioned the man. +ACIAIg-No one has ever been with me three nights in a row. Where are you from?+ACIAIg- she asked. The man replied, +ACIAIg- South Carolina.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Really+ACIAIg- she said. +ACIAIg-I have family in South Carolina.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-I know,+ACIAIg- the man said. +ACIAIg-Your father died, and I am your sister's attorney.

+ACI-Things I've Learned From My Children 01. A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000 sq. foot house 4 inches deep. 02. If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with roller blades, they can ignite. 03. A 3+AC0-year+AC0-olds voice is louder than 200 adults in a crowded restaurant. 04. If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong enough to rotate a 42 pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a superman cape. It is strong enough, however, if tied to a paint can, to spread paint on all four walls of a 20 by 20 foot room. 05. You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on. When using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball up a few times before you get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way. 06. The glass in windows (even double pane) doesn't stop a baseball hit by a ceiling fan. 07. When you hear the toilet flush and the words +ACIAIg-Uh+AC0-oh,+ACIAIg- it's already too late. 08. Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it. 09. A six+AC0-year+AC0-old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a 36+AC0-year+AC0-old man says they can only do it in the movies. 10. Certain Legos will pass through the digestive tract of a four+AC0-year+AC0-old. 11. Play Dough and Microwave should never be used in the same sentence. 12. Super glue is forever. 13. No matter how much Jell+AC0-O you put in a swimming pool you still can't walk on water. 14. Pool filters do not like Jell+AC0-O. 15. VCR's do not eject PB+ACY-J+ADs- sandwiches even though TV commercials show they do. 16. Garbage bags do not make good parachutes. 17. Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when driving. 18. You probably do not want to know what that odor is. 19. Always look in the oven before you turn it on. Plastic toys do not like ovens. 20. The fire department in Austin, TX has a 5+AC0-minute response time. 21. The spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earthworms dizzy. 22. It will however make cats dizzy. 23. Cats throw up twice their body weight when dizzy. 24. The mind of a six+AC0-year+AC0-old is wonderful.+ACI-

For the past several weeks I've enjoyed some of the best moments in my life with the most fabulous looking women.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-So, what's your problem?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-I don't have a problem,+ACIAIg- the man replied. +ACIAIg-My wife does.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-A man took his old duck to the Doctor, concerned because the duck wouldn't eat. The Doctor explained to the man that as ducks age their upper bills grow down over their lower bills and make it difficult for the animal to pick up it's food. +ACIAIg-What you need to do is gently file the upper bill down even with the lower bill. But you must be extra careful because the duck's nostrils are located in the upper bill and if you file down too far, when the duck takes a drink of water it'll drown.+ACIAIg- The man goes about his business and about a week later the Doctor runs into his patient. +ACIAIg-Well, how is that duck of yours?+ACIAIg- the Doctor inquires. +ACIAIg-He's dead.+ACIAIg- declared the heartbroken man. +ACIAIg-I told you not to file his upper bill down too far+ACE- He took a drink of water and drowned didn't he?+ACIAIg- insisted the Doctor. +ACIAIg-No.+ACIAIg- lamented the man. +ACIAIg-I think he was dead before I took him out of the vise.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-A champion jockey is about to enter an important race on a new horse. The horse's trainer meets him before the race and says, +ACIAIg-All you have to remember with this horse is that every time you approach a jump, you have to shout, 'ALLLLEEE OOOP+ACE-' really loudly in the horse's ear. Providing you do that, you'll be fine.+ACIAIg- The jockey thinks the trainer is mad but promises to shout the command. The race begins and they approach the first hurdle. The jockey ignores the trainer's ridiculous advice and the horse crashes straight through the center of the jump. They carry on and approach the second hurdle. The jockey, somewhat embarrassed, whispers 'Aleeee ooop' in the horse's ear. The same thing happens+AC0ALQ-the horse crashes straight through the center of the jump. At the third hurdle, the jockey thinks, +ACIAIg-It's no good, I'll have to do it,+ACIAIg- and yells, +ACIAIg-ALLLEEE OOOP+ACEAIgAi- really loudly. Sure enough, the horse sails over the jump with no problems. This continues for the rest of the race, but due to the earlier problems the horse only finishes third. The trainer is fuming and asks the jockey what went wrong. The jockey replies, +ACIAIg-Nothing is wrong with me +AC0- it's this horse. What is he +AC0- deaf or something?+ACIAIg- The trainer replies, +ACIAIg-Deaf?? DEAF?? He's not deaf+AC0ALQ-he's BLIND+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

+ACI-There once was a monastery that was very strict. Following a vow of silence, no one was allowed to speak at all. But there was one exception to this rule. Every ten years, the monks were permitted to speak just two words. After spending his first ten years at the monastery, one monk went to the head monk. +ACIAIg-It has been ten years,+ACIAIg- said the head monk. +ACIAIg-What are the two words you would like to speak?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Bed... hard...+ACIAIg- said the monk. +ACIAIg-I see,+ACIAIg- replied the head monk. Ten years later, the monk returned to the head monk's office. +ACIAIg-It has been ten more years,+ACIAIg- said the head monk. +ACIAIg-What are the two words you would like to speak?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Food... stinks...+ACIAIg- said the monk. +ACIAIg-I see,+ACIAIg- replied the head monk. Yet another ten years passed and the monk once again met with the head monk who asked, +ACIAIg-What are your two words now, after these ten years?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-I... quit+ACEAIgAi- said the monk. +ACIAIg-Well, I can see why,+ACIAIg- replied the head monk. +ACIAIg-All you ever do is complain.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-A man was in a terrible accident, and his 'manhood' was mangled and torn from his body.

The doctor said the cost would be +ACQ-3,500 for 'small, +ACQ-6,500 for 'medium, and +ACQ-14,000 for 'large.' The man was sure he would want a medium or large, but the doctor urged him to talk it over with his wife before he made any decision. The man called his wife on the phone and explained their options. The doctor came back into the room, and found the man looking dejected. 'Well, what have the two of you decided?' asked the doctor. 'She'd rather remodel the kitchen.'+ACI-

They go back to his place, and as he shows her around his apartment, she notices that his bedroom is completely packed with sweet cuddly teddy bears. Hundreds of cute small bears on a shelf all the way along the floor. Cuddly medium+AC0-sized ones on a shelf a little higher. Huge enormous bears on the top shelf along the wall. The woman is surprised that this guy would have a collection of teddy bears, especially one that's so extensive, but she decides not to mention this to him, and actually is quite impressed by this evidence of his sensitive side+ACE- She turns to him, invitingly... they kiss...and then they rip each other's clothes off and make hot steamy love.

One turns to the other and says: +ACIAIg-You know last week I discovered that if you jump from the top of this building+AC0- by the time you fall to the 10th floor, the winds around the building are so intense that they carry you around the building and back into the window.+ACIAIg- The bartender just shakes his head in disapproval while wiping the bar. The 2nd Man says: +ACIAIg-What are you a nut? There is no way in heck that could happen.+ACIAIg- 1st Man: +ACIAIg-No, it's true let me prove it to you.+ACIAIg- So he gets up from the bar, jumps over the balcony, and careens to the street below. When he passes the 10th floor, the high wind whips him around the building and back into the 10th floor window and he takes the elevator back up to the bar. The 2nd Man tells him: +ACIAIg-You know I saw that with my own eyes, but that must have been a one time fluke.+ACIAIg- 1st Man: +ACIAIg-No, I'll prove it again+ACIAIg- and again he jumps and hurtles toward the street where the 10th floor wind gently carries him around the building and into the window. Once upstairs he urges his fellow drinker to try it. 2nd Man: +ACIAIg-Well what the heck, it works, I'll try it.+ACIAIg- So he jumps over the balcony, plunges downward, passes the 11th, 10th, 9th, 8th floors and hits the sidewalk with a 'splat.'

When the boy asked how she knew, she again said, +ACIAIg-Just a lucky guess.+ACIAIg- Finally, a boy whose father owned a liquor store came up and gave the teacher a box, but one of the box's corners was damp from a leak.

Finally, she gave up and asked him what was in the box. He said happily,+ACIAIg-A puppy+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-
+ACI-There was once an aspiring veterinarian who put himself through veterinary school working nights as a taxidermist.

+ACI-A small town prosecuting attorney called his first witness to the stand in a trial +AC0ALQ- a grandmotherly, elderly woman. He approached her and asked, +ACIAIg-Mrs. Jones, do you know me?+ACIAIg- She responded, +ACIAIg-Why, yes, I do know you, Mr. Burns. I've known you since you were a young boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, cheat on your wife, you manipulate people, and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a rising big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you never will amount to anything more than a two+AC0-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.+ACIAIg- The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, +ACIAIg-Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?+ACIAIg- She again replied, +ACIAIg-Why, yes I do. I've known Mr. Trevino since he was a youngster, too. I used to baby+AC0-sit him for his parents. And he, too, has been a real disappointment to me. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. The man can't build a normal relationship with anyone and his law practice is one of the shoddiest in the entire state. Yes, I know him.+ACIAIg- At this point, the judge rapped the courtroom to silence, and called both counselors to the bench. In a very quiet voice, he said with menace, +ACIAIg-If either of you asks her if she knows me, you'll be jailed for contempt+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

+ACI-Bush and Osama decided to settle the war once and for all. They sat down and decided to settle the whole dispute with one dog fight. They would have 5 years to breed the best fighting dog in the world and whichever side's dog won would be entitled to dominate the world. Osama found the biggest, meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the world and bred them with the meanest Siberian wolves. They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from the litter, and removed his siblings, which gave him all the milk. After 5 years, they came up with the biggest, meanest dog the world had ever seen. Its cage needed steel bars that were 5 +ACIAIg-thick and nobody could get near it. When the day came for the dog fight, Bush showed up with a very strange looking animal. It was a 9 foot long Dachshund. Everyone felt sorry for Bush because there was no way that this dog could possibly last even 10 seconds with the Afghanistani dog. When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund came out of its cage and slowly waddled over toward Osama's dog. Osama's dog snarled and leaped out of its cage and charged the America Dachshund at full speed. But when it got close enough to bite, the Dachshund opened his mouth and consumed Osama's dog in one bite. There was nothing left of his dog at all. Osama came up to Bush, shaking his head in disbelief, +ACIAIg-We don't understand how this could have happened. We had our best people working for 5 years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the world, and the biggest and meanest Siberian wolves.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-That's nothing,+ACIAIg- said Bush. +ACIAIg-We had Michael Jackson's plastic surgeons working for 5 years to make that alligator look like a wiener dog.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-A beautiful young girl is about to undergo a minor operation. She's laid on a hospital trolley bed with nothing on, except a sheet over her. The nurse pushes the trolley down the corridor towards the operating theatre, where she leaves the girl on the trolley outside, while she goes in to check whether everything is ready. A young man wearing a white coat approaches, lifts the sheet up and starts examining her naked body. He puts the sheet back and then walks away and talks to another man in a white coat. The second man comes over, lifts the sheet and does the same examinations. When a third man does the same thing, but more closely, she grows impatient and says: +ACIAIg-All these examinations are fine and appreciated, but when are you going to start the operation?+ACIAIg- The man in the white coat shrugged his shoulders: +ACIAIg-I have no idea.

+ACI-In the year 2005, the Lord came unto Noah, who was now living in the United States, and said, +ACIAIg-Once again the earth has become wicked and overpopulated, and I see the end of all flesh before me. Build another Ark and save 2 of every living thing along with a few good humans, thy sons and their wives.+ACIAIg- He gave Noah the blueprints, saying, +ACIAIg-You have 6 months to build the Ark before I will start the unending rain for 40 days and 40 nights.+ACIAIg- Six months later, the Lord looked down and saw Noah weeping in his yard +AC0ALQ- but no Ark. +ACIAIg-Noah+ACEAIgAi- He roared, +ACIAIg-I'm about to start the rain+ACE- Where is the Ark?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Forgive me, Lord,+ACIAIg- begged Noah, +ACIAIg-but things have changed. +ACIAIg-I needed a building permit. I've been arguing with the inspector about the need for a sprinkler system. My neighbors claim that I've violated the neighborhood zoning laws by building the Ark in my yard and exceeding the height limitations. We had to go to the Development Appeal Board for a decision. +ACIAIg-Then the Department of Transportation demanded a bond be posted for the future costs of moving power lines and other overhead obstructions, to clear the passage for the Ark's move to the sea. I told them that the sea would be coming to us, but they would hear nothing of it. +ACIAIg-Getting the wood was another problem. There's a ban on cutting local trees in order to save the spotted owl. I tried to convince the environmentaliststhat I needed the wood to save the owls +AC0ALQ- but no go+ACE- +ACIAIg-When I started gathering the animals, I got sued by an animal rights group. They insisted that I was confining wild animals against their will. They argued the accommodation was too restrictive, and it was cruel and inhumane to put so many animals in a confined space. I am required to apply for 834 different licenses to keep wild beasts on private property. +ACIAIg-Then the EPA ruled that I couldn't build the Ark until they'd conducted an environmental impact study on Your proposed flood. Further, the pitch to water+AC0-poof the ark has been banned by the EPA as inimical to the environment. +ACIAIg-I'm still trying to resolve a complaint with the Human Rights Commission on how many minorities I'm supposed to hire for my building crew. +ACIAIg-Immigration and Naturalization is checking the green+AC0-card status of most of the people who want to work. The scaffolding to build the superstructure is not OSHA+AC0-approved and is forbidden to use except for private structures less than 5 cubits.. +ACIAIg-The trades unions say I can't use my sons. They insist I have to hire only Union workers with Ark+AC0-building experience. +ACIAIg-To make matters worse, the IRS seized all my assets, claiming I'm trying to leave the country illegally with endangered species. +ACIAIg-So, forgive me, Lord, but it would take at least 100 years for me to finish this Ark.+ACIAIg- Suddenly the skies cleared, the sun began to shine, and a rainbow stretched across the sky.

+ACI-The night before one exam, two students tied one on, (well, actually, tied two on, one each), and managed to sleep through the final. They realized they were in serious trouble, so they agreed to tell the professor that they had a flat tire on the way to the exam. ''No problem.+ACIAIg- said the Professor, ''Come by my office at 5 P.M. and I'll give you the exam then.+ACIAIg- Feeling pretty clever, the students spent the intervening time getting information on the exam from students who had already taken it, and making sure they knew how to do the problems. Coming to the professor's office that evening, they were told, ''Leave your books in my office, and I'll put you in two separate rooms for the exam.+ACIAIg- They were both ecstatic to see that the Professor had given them the exact same exam taken by the class that morning. However, there was an additional page tacked on the end, upon which was written, ''For 50+ACU- of the grade, which tire was flat?+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-A lady is throwing a party for her granddaughter, and had gone all out..... a caterer, band, and a hired clown. Just before the party started, two bums showed up looking for a handout. Feeling sorry for the bums, the woman told them that she would give them a meal if they will help chop some wood for her out back. Gratefully, they headed to the rear of the house. The guests arrived, and all was going well with the children having a wonderful time. But the clown hadn't shown up. After a half and hour, the clown finally called to report that he was stuck in traffic, and would probably not make the party at all. The woman was very disappointed and unsuccessfully tried to entertain the children herself. She happened to look out the window and saw one of the bums doing cartwheels across the lawn. She watched in awe as he swung from tree branches, did mid+AC0-air flips, and leaped high in the air. She spoke to the other bum and said, +ACIAIg-What your friend is doing is absolutely marvelous. I have never seen such a thing. Do you think your friend would consider repeating this performance for the children at the party? I would pay him +ACQ-50+ACEAIgAi- The other bum says, +ACIAIg-Well, I dunno. Let me ask him. 'HEY WILLIE+ACE- FOR +ACQ-50, WOULD YOU CHOP OFF ANOTHER TOE?+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-It's time once again to consider the candidates for the annual Stella Awards. The Stella's are named after 81+AC0-year+AC0-old Stella Liebeck who spilled coffee on herself and successfully sued McDonalds. That case inspired the Stella Awards for the most frivolous successful lawsuits in the United States. The following are this year's candidates: 1. Kara Walton of Claymont, Delaware, successfully sued the owner of a nightclub in a neighboring city when she fell from the bathroom window to the floor and knocked out her two front teeth. This occurred while Ms. Walton was trying to sneak through the window in the ladies room to avoid paying the +ACQ-3.50 cover charge. She was awarded +ACQ-12,000 and dental expenses. 2. Jerry Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas, was awarded +ACQ-14,500 and medical expenses after being bitten on the buttocks by his next+AC0-door neighbor's beagle. The beagle was on a chain in its owner's fenced yard. The award was less than sought because the jury felt the dog might have been just a little provoked at the time by Mr. Williams who was shooting it repeatedly with a pellet gun. 3. A 19+AC0-year+AC0-old Carl Truman of Los Angeles won +ACQ-74,000 and medical expenses when his neighbor ran over his hand with a Honda Accord. Mr. Truman apparently didn't notice there was someone at the wheel of the car when he was trying to steal his neighbor's hub caps. 4. A. Philadelphia restaurant was ordered to pay Amber Carson of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, +ACQ-113,500 a+ACE- after she slipped on a soft drink spill and broke her coccyx (tailbone). The beverage was on the floor because Ms. Carson had thrown it at her boyfriend 30 seconds earlier during an argument. 5. Terrence Dickson of Bristol, Pennsylvania, was leaving a house he had just finished robbing by way of the garage. He was not able to get the garage door to go up since the automatic door opener was malfunctioning. He couldn't reenter the house because the door connecting the house and garage locked when he pulled it shut. The family was on vacation, and Mr. Dickson found himself locked in the garage for eight days. He subsisted on a case of Pepsi he found and a large bag of dry dog food. He sued the homeowner's insurance claiming the situation caused him undue mental anguish. The jury agreed to the tune of +ACQ-500,000. 6. A jury of her peers awarded Kathleen Robertson of Austin, Texas, +ACQ-780,000 after breaking her ankle by tripping over a toddler who was running inside a furniture store. The owners of the store were understandably surprised at the verdict, considering the misbehaving little toddler was Ms. Robertson's son. 7. This year's favorite could easily be Mr. Merv Grazinski of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Mr. Grazinski purchased a brand new 32+AC0-foot Winnebago motor home. On his first trip home, having driven onto the freeway, he set the cruise control at 70 mph and calmly left the drivers seat to go into the back and make himself a cup of coffee. Not surprisingly, the R.V. left the freeway, crashed and overturned. Mr. Grazinski sued Winnebago for not advising him in the owner's manual that he couldn't actually do this. The jury awarded him +ACQ-1,750,000 plus a new motor home. The company actually changed their manuals on the basis of this suit, just in case there were any other complete morons buying their recreation vehicles.+ACI-

The official asked, +ACIAIg-Father, do you have anything to declare?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-From the top of my head down to my waist, I have nothing to declare.+ACIAIg- The official thought this answer strange, so asked, +ACIAIg-And what do you have to declare from your waist to the floor?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-I have a marvellous little instrument designed to be used on a woman, but which is, to date, unused.+ACIAIg- Roaring with laughter, the official said, +ACIAIg-Go ahead, Father.+ACIAIg- Next+ACE-+ACI-

+ACI-A priest is walking down the street one day when he notices a very small boy trying to press a doorbell on a house across the street. However, the boy is very small and the doorbell is too high for him to reach. After watching the boys efforts for some time, the priest moves closer to the boy's position. He steps smartly across the street, walks up behind the little fellow and, placing his hand kindly on the child's shoulder leans over and gives the doorbell a sold ring. Crouching down to the child's level, the priest smiles benevolently and asks, +ACIAIg-And now what, my little man?+ACIAIg- To which the boy replies, +ACIAIg-Now we run+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

It's +ACQ-1.50 per roll.+ACIAIg- He grabs another and says, +ACIAIg-This is nice and soft as a bunny, strong but gentle, and it's +ACQ-1.00 a roll.+ACIAIg- Pointing to the bottom shelf he tells her, +ACIAIg-We call that our No Name brand, and it's 20 cents per roll.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Give me the No Name,+ACIAIg- she says. She comes back about a week later, seeks out the manager and says, +ACIAIg-Hey+ACE- I've got a name for your No Name toilet paper.

+ACI-It is not a well known fact, but soccer was very popular in ancient Rome. The Coliseum was used for matches. There was a big match planned for one Saturday, and three famous Romans arranged to meet at the Coliseum to see the match (Rome vs. Naples). When the day came, Caesar and Cassius met in their favorite bar, but there was no sign of their friend Brutus. So shortly before the kick+AC0-off, they gave up and went to their reserved seats to watch the game.

+ACI-Fay Chester was a busy housewife with a demanding husband, six children and a large house. The only relief she got from her chores was the twice+AC0-a+AC0-week bridge game she shared with a dozen other women. The only flaw in the bridge club relationship was that Fay loved to tell off+AC0-color stories and the girls didn't want to hear them. To teach Fay a lesson, the other women decided that the next time she told an off+AC0-color story, they'd just get up, walk out, meet at another home but without Fay. Sure enough, at the next meeting, Fay started, +ACIAIg-You know, girls, there's a rumor going around that a busload of prostitutes will be leaving in the morning for that big gold find up in Alaska, and they say....+ACIAIg- Just then, the women all stood up and started for the door. Fay was disconcerted but only for a moment, then she understood what was going on and said, +ACIAIg-Hey+ACE- Girls+ACE- Hold on, hold on+ACE- There's plenty of time 'cause the bus doesn't leave till morning+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

I'm the man who wears the pants in this family.+ACIAIg- With that she flipped him her panties and said, +ACIAIg-Try these on.+ACIAIg- He tried them on and found he could only get them on as far as his kneecaps. +ACIAIg-Hell,+ACIAIg- he said.

+ACI-1. Never give me work in the morning. Always wait until 4:00 and then bring it to me. The challenge of a deadline is refreshing. 2. If it's really a rush job, run in and interrupt me every 10 minutes to inquire how it's going. That helps. Or even better, hover behind me, advising me at every keystroke. 3. Always leave without telling anyone where you're going. It gives me a chance to be creative when someone asks where you are. 4. If my arms are full of papers, boxes, books, or supplies, don't open the door for me. I need to learn how to function as a paraplegic and opening doors with no arms is good training in case I should ever be injured and lose all use of my limbs. 5. If you give me more than one job to do, don't tell me which is the priority. I am psychic. 6. Do your best to keep me late. I adore this office and really have nowhere to go or anything to do. I have no life beyond work. 7. If a job I do pleases you, keep it a secret. If that gets out, it could mean a promotion. 8. If you don't like my work, tell everyone. I like my name to be popular in conversations. I was born to be whipped. 9. If you have special instructions for a job, don't write them down. In fact, save them until the job is almost done. No use confusing me with useful information. 10. Never introduce me to the people you're with. I have no right to know anything. In the corporate food chain, I am plankton. When you refer to them later, my shrewd deductions will identify them. 11. Be nice to me only when the job I'm doing for you could really change your life and send you straight to manager's hell. 12. Tell me all your little problems. No one else has any and it's nice to know someone is less fortunate. I especially like the story about having to pay so much taxes on the bonus check you received for being such a good manager. 13. Wait until my yearly review and THEN tell me what my goals SHOULD have been. Give me a mediocre performance rating with a cost of living increase. I'm not here for the money anyway.+ACI-

The beggar thanks him kindly and then continues on to the other passengers. Frank is outraged by his friend's act of generosity. +ACIAIg-What on earth did you do that for?+ACIAIg- shouts Frank. +ACIAIg-You know he's only going to use it on drugs or booze.+ACIAIg- Matt replies, +ACIAIg-And we weren't?+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-Written by Phil Maggitti Going to War with the Army that We Want. WASHINGTON, D.C. +AC0- President George W. Bush announced yesterday that with the holiday season at an end he will mobilize selected units of the Salvation Army in order to boost troop levels in Iraq. The designated units+AC0-the 15th Strip Mall Patrol and the 17th Kmart Brigade+AC0-will receive eight weeks of intensive training prior to being deployed. +ACIAIg-The Salvation Army has a proud history of serving pastries and hot coffee to battlefield troops since World War I,+ACIAIg- said the president, +ACIAIg-but desperate measures call for desperate times and vice versa. Therefore, I have authorized the establishment of Operation Kettle Korps, a program that will train members of the Salvation Army for combat duty.+ACIAIg- At a brief question+AC0-and+AC0-answer session following this announcement, CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked the president whether Operation Kettle Korps amounted to a back door draft. +ACIAIg-No,+ACIAIg- said Bush. +ACIAIg-These units are already in the army, aren't they?+ACIAIg- Embattled secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld, taking time out from hand+AC0-writing letters of condolence to the families of soldiers killed recently in Iraq, praised the decision to mobilize the Salvation Army. +ACIAIg-Do I think this is a good idea?+ACIAIg- asked Rumsfeld, jabbing the air with his calligraphy pen for emphasis. +ACIAIg-Of course I do. It's about time we went to war with the army that we want. If ever there was an army with God on its side, the Salvation Army is it. Besides, we undermine troop morale if some members of the army are getting their guts shot out while others are standing around asking, 'Decaf or regular?'+ACIAIg- John Larsson, the Salvation Army's general, also endorsed the mobilization. Larrson spoke with reporters on Kettle Force 1, his army's private jet, while on his way to South Asia. +ACIAIg-I have received a number of inquiries from our soldiers who were itching to kill a few terrorists for Christ,+ACIAIg- he said. +ACIAIg-I'm happy that Jesus has seen fit through his minister on earth to give them their chance. Christ be supreme.+ACIAIg- The first contingent of Operation Kettle Korps troops is scheduled to arrive at Fort Benning, Georgia, on January 15. After they have been trained and sent to Iraq, Salvation Army members currently serving pastries and coffee to troops will return to the United States for military training. Their duties in Iraq will be assumed by members of Arnie's Army, a private noncombat force maintained by golfer Arnie Palmer. In related news, Tiger Woods said that his army was +ACIAIg-not up to fighting right now, as we've been in a slump recently.+ACIAIg- Woods said that as soon as his members had worked out the kinks in their bayonet swing, they would be +ACIAIg-ready for the majors.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-Last year, when the power mower was broken and wouldn't run, I kept hinting to my husband that he ought to get it fixed, but somehow the message never sank in. Finally I thought of a clever way to make the point. When my husband arrived home that day, he found me seated in the tall grass, busily snipping away with a tiny pair of sewing scissors. He watched silently for a short time and then went into the house. He was gone only a few moments when he came out again. He handed me a toothbrush. +ACIAIg-When you finish cutting the grass,+ACIAIg- he said, +ACIAIg-you might as well sweep the sidewalks.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-A newlywed farmer and his wife were visited by her mother, who immediately demanded an inspection of the place. The Farmer had genuinely tried to be friendly to his new mother+AC0-in+AC0-law, hoping that it could be a friendly, non+AC0-antagonistic relationship. To no avail, she kept nagging them at every opportunity, demanding changes, offering unwanted advice and making life unbearable to the farmer and his new bride. While they were walking through the barn, the farmer's mule suddenly reared up and kicked the mother+AC0-in+AC0-law in the head, killing her instantly. At the funeral service a few days later, the farmer stood near the casket and greeted folks as they walked by. The pastor noticed that whenever a man would whisper something to the farmer, he would nod his head yes and say something. Whenever a man walked by and whispered to the farmer, however, he would shake his head, no and mumble a reply. Very curious as to this bizarre behavior, the pastor later asked the farmer what that was all about. The farmer replied, +ACIAIg-The women would say, 'What a terrible tragedy' and I would nod my head and say, 'Yes, it was.' The men would ask, 'Can I borrow that mule?' and I would shake my head and say, 'Can't. It's all booked up for a year.'+ACI-
+ACI-Three men were fishing in the Gulf of Mexico when one of them pulled in a huge fish.

The fishermen's boat got so many holes they had to swim ashore, and from that day to this, they have never forgotten Neptune's eighteen hole gulf curse.+ACI-

+ACI-A big city lawyer went duck hunting in rural North Wairarapa. He shot and dropped a bird, but it fell into a farmer's field on the other side of a fence. As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on his tractor and asked him what he was doing.The litigator responded, +ACIAIg-I shot a duck and it fell in this field, and now I'm going to retrieve it.+ACIAIg- The old farmer replied, +ACIAIg-This is my property, and you are not coming over here.+ACIAIg- The indignant lawyer said, +ACIAIg-I am one of the best trial attorneys in New Zealand and, if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and take everything you own.+ACIAIg- The old farmer smiled and said, +ACIAIg-Apparently, you don't know how we settle disputes in North Wairarapa. We settle small disagreements like this with the 'Three Kick Rule.'+ACIAIg- The lawyer asked, +ACIAIg-What is the 'Three Kick Rule'?+ACIAIg- The Farmer replied, +ACIAIg-Well, because the dispute occurs on my land, I get to go first. I kick you three times and then you kick me three times and so on back and forth until someone gives up.+ACIAIg- The attorney quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom. The old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the attorney. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy steel toed work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees+ACE- His second kick to the midriff sent the lawyer's last meal gushing from his mouth. The lawyer was on all fours when the farmer's third kick to his rear end, sent him face+AC0-first into a fresh cow pie. The lawyer summoned every bit of his will and remaining strength and very slowly managed to get to his feet. Wiping his face with the arm of his jacket, he said, +ACIAIg-Okay, you old fart. Now it's my turn.+ACIAIg- The old farmer smiled and said, +ACIAIg-Nah, I give up. You can have the duck.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-An old farmer had owned a large farm for several years and in the back forty it had a nice pond, picnic tables, horseshoe courts, basketball court,etc. The pond was fixed for swimming when it was built. One evening the old farmer decided to go down to the pond, as he hadn't been there for a while, and look it over. As he neared the pond, he heard voices shouting and laughing with glee. As he came closer he saw it was a bunch of young women skinny+AC0-dipping in his pond. He made the women aware of his presence and they all went to the deep end of the pond. One of the women shouted to him, +ACIAIg-We're not coming out until you leave+ACEAIgAi- The old man replied, +ACIAIg-I didn't come down here to watch you ladies swim or make you get out of the pond, I only came to feed my alligators.+ACIAIg- Old age +ACY- cunning will triumph over youth +ACY- skill every time+ACE-+ACI-

But it's something you'd better discuss with your wife. I mean, if you had a five inch one before, and you decide to go for a nine incher, she might be a bit put out. But if you had a nine inch one before, and you decide only to invest in a five incher this time, she might be disappointed. So it's important that she plays a role in helping you make the decision.+ACIAIg- The man agrees to talk with his wife. The doctor comes back the next day. +ACIAIg-So,+ACIAIg- says the doctor, +ACIAIg-have you spoken with your wife?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-I have,+ACIAIg- says the man. +ACIAIg-And has she helped you in making the decision?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-She has,+ACIAIg- says the man. +ACIAIg-And what is it?+ACIAIg- asks the doctor. +ACIAIg-We're getting a new kitchen.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-A lawyer from New York was transferred to a small frontier town during the settlement of the West. After several weeks there he noticed that the town was populated solely by men. He asked one of the local cowboys, +ACIAIg-What do you do when you get the urge for a woman?+ACIAIg- The cowboy replied, +ACIAIg-See them thar'sheep up on thet hill. We just go git us one.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-That is disgusting and barbaric+ACEAIQAiACI- replied the lawyer. After about 3 months the lawyer could not stand it any longer. He decided though, if he was going to do a sheep, he would show these yokels how to do it right. He picked out the prettiest sheep of the bunch, bathed her, put a pink ribbon on her, served her hay on a china plate, dressed her in fine lingerie,and then took the sheep to bed. After he finished he decided to take his new found lover out for a drink. He wandered into the local saloon with the sheep under his arm. The piano fell silent, people dropped drinks, and all the cowboys turned, and stared in shocked disbelief. The lawyer said, +ACIAIg-You bunch of hypocrites. You look at me as if I'm some sort of freak for doing what you've been doing all along.

+ACI-Young King Arthur was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of a neighboring kingdom. The monarch could have killed him but was moved by Arthur's youth and ideals. So, the monarch offered him his freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult question. Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer and, if after a year, he still had no answer, he would be put to death. The question?...What do women really want? Such a question would perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and to young Arthur, it seemed an impossible query. But, since it was better than death, he accepted the monarch's proposition to have an answer by year's end. He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everyone: the princess, the priests, the wise men and even the court jester. He spoke with everyone, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. Many people advised him to consult the old witch, for only she would have the answer. But the price would be high+ADs- as the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged. The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no choice but to talk to the witch. She agreed to answer the question, but he would have to agree to her price first. The old witch wanted to marry Sir Lancelot, the most noble of the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend+ACE- Young Arthur was horrified. She was hunchbacked and hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage, made obscene noises, etc. He had never encountered such a repugnant creature in all his life. He refused to force his friend to marry her and endure such a terrible burden, but Lancelot, learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur. He said nothing was too big of a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the preservation of the Round Table. Hence, a wedding was proclaimed and the witch answered Arthur's question thus: What a woman really wants, she answered....is to be in charge of her own life. Everyone in the kingdom instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that Arthur's life would be spared. And so it was, the neighboring monarch granted Arthur his freedom and Lancelot and the witch had a wonderful wedding. The honeymoon hour approached and Lancelot, steeling himself for a horrific experience, entered the bedroom. But, what a sight awaited him. The most beautiful woman he had ever seen, lay before him on the bed. The astounded Lancelot asked what had happened. The beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her when she appeared as a witch, she would henceforth, be her horrible deformed self only half the time and the beautiful maiden the other half. Which would he prefer? Beautiful during the day...or night? Lancelot pondered the predicament. During the day, a beautiful woman to show off to his friends, but at night, in the privacy of his castle, an old witch? Or, would he prefer having a hideous witch during the day, but by night, a beautiful woman for him to enjoy wondrous, intimate moments? What would YOU do? Noble Lancelot, knowing the answer the witch gave Arthur to his question, said that he would allow HER to make the choice herself. Upon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time because he had respected her enough to let her be in charge of her own life. Now....what is the moral to this story? The moral is.... If you don't let a woman have her own way.... Things are going to get ugly.+ACI-

Anxious to know more the girl leads the man and the dog into a little room above the bar. She undresses and full of expectation she lies down on the bed.

+ACI-One afternoon, a wealthy lawyer was riding in the back of his limousine when he saw two men eating grass by the road side. He ordered his driver to stop and he got out to investigate. +ACIAIg-Why are you eating grass?+ACIAIg- he asked one man. +ACIAIg-We don't have any money for food.+ACIAIg- the poor man replied. +ACIAIg-Oh, come along with me then.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-But sir, I have a wife with two children+ACEAIgAi- +ACIAIg-Bring them along+ACE- And you, come with us too+ACEAIgAi-, he said to the other man. +ACIAIg-But sir, I have a wife with six children+ACEAIgAi- the second man answered. +ACIAIg-Bring them as well+ACEAIgAi- They all climbed into the car, which was no easy task, even for a car as large as the limo.

I will, however, keep your name on file should an opening become available.

+ACI-Monday: It's fun to cook for Bob. Today I made angel food cake. The recipe said beat 12 eggs separately. The neighbors were nice enough to loan me some extra bowls. Tuesday: Bob wanted fruit salad for supper. The recipe said serve without dressing. So I didn't dress. What a surprise when Bob brought a friend home for supper. Wednesday: A good day for rice. The recipe said wash thoroughly before steaming the rice. It seemed kinda of silly but I took a bath. I can't say it improved the rice any. Thursday: Today Bob asked for salad again. I tried a new recipe. It said prepare ingredients, then toss on a bed of lettuce one hour before serving. Which is what led up to Bob asking me why I was rolling around in the garden. Friday: I found an easy recipe for cookies. It said put all ingredients in bowl and beat it. There must have been something wrong with this recipe. When I got back, everything was the same as when I left. Saturday: Bob did the shopping today and brought home a chicken. He asked me to dress it for Sunday (oh boy). For some reason Bob keeps counting to ten. Sunday: Bob's folks came to dinner. I wanted to serve roast. All I could find was hamburger. Suddenly I had a flash of genius. I put the hamburger in the oven and set the controls for roast. It still came out hamburger, much to my disappointment. Good Night Dear Diary. This has been a very exciting week. I am eager for tomorrow to come so I can try out a new recipe on Bob. If we could just get a bigger oven, I would like to surprise him with Chocolate Moose.+ACI-
Can I integrate myself with respect to you?
+ACI-I. There are approximately two billion children (persons under 18) in the world. However, since Santa does not visit children of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish or Buddhist religions, this reduces the workload for Christmas night to 15+ACU- of the total, or 378 million (according to the Population Reference Bureau). At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per house hold, that comes to 108 million homes, presuming that there is at least one good child in each. II. Santa has about 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 967.7 visits per second. This is to say that for each Christian household with a good child, Santa has around 1/1000th of a second to park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left for him, get back up the chimney, jump into the sleigh and get on to the next house. Assuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false, but will accept for the purposes of our calculations), we are now talking about 0.78 miles per household+ADs- a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting bathroom stops or breaks. This means Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second +AC0ALQAt- 3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man+AC0-made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second, and a conventional reindeer can run (at best) 15 miles per hour. III. The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium sized Lego set (two pounds), the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousand tons, not counting Santa himself. On land, a conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that the +ACIAIg-flying+ACIAIg- reindeer could pull ten times the normal amount, the job can't be done with eight or even nine of them+AC0ALQAt- Santa would need 360,000 of them. This increases the payload, not counting the weight of the sleigh, another 54,000 tons, or roughly seven times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth (the ship, not the monarch). IV. 600,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance +AC0ALQAt- this would heat up the reindeer in the same fashion as a spacecraft re+AC0-entering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer would absorb 14.3 quintillion joules of energy per second each. In short, they would burst into flames almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them and creating deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team would be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second, or right about the time Santa reached the fifth house on his trip. Not that it matters, however, since Santa, as a result of accelerating from a dead stop to 650 m.p.s. in .001 seconds, would be subjected to centrifugal forces of 17,500 g's. A 250 pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force, instantly crushing his bones and organs and reducing him to a quivering blob of pink goo. Therefore, if Santa did exist, he's dead now.+ACI-

+ACI-There was a preacher who was an avid golfer. Every chance that he could get, he could be found on the golf course swinging away. On one particular Sunday it turned out to be a picture perfect day for golfing. The sun was shining, the temperature was just right and there was very little wind. The preacher was in a quandary and wasn't sure what to do....play golf or give the Sunday service. The urge to play golf overcame him and he called in his assistant to take care of the Sunday service for him. The preacher packed up his car and drove 3 hours to a course where no one would recognize him. An angel above was watching the preacher and was quite perturbed. The angel went to God and said, +ACIAIg-look at the preacher. He should punished for what he is doing.+ACIAIg- God nodded in agreement. All alone but enjoying it immensely, the preacher teed up on the first hole. He swung at the ball and hit a perfect drive. The ball ripped through the still air straight as an arrow and 400 yards later it landed the green where it gently rolled into the cup. A tremendous hole in one+ACE- The preacher was amazed and excited. The angel was in shock.

+ACI-As a bagpiper, I was asked by a funeral director to play at a graveside service for a homeless man who had no family or friends. The funeral was to be held at a cemetery in the remote countryside and this man would be the first to be laid to rest there. As I was not familiar with the backwoods area, I became lost and being a typical man, did not stop for directions. I finally arrived an hour late. I saw the backhoe and the crew who were eating lunch but the hearse was nowhere in sight. I apologized to the workers for my tardiness and stepped to the side of the open grave where I saw the vault lid already in place. I assured the workers I would not hold them up for long but this was the proper thing to do. The workers gathered around, still eating their lunch. I played out my heart and soul. As I played the workers began to weep. I played and I played like I'd never played before, from 'Going Home' and 'The Lord is My Shepherd' to 'Flowers of the Forest.' I closed the lengthy session with 'Amazing Grace' and walked to my car. As I was opening the door and taking off my coat, I overheard one of the workers saying to another, +ACIAIg-Man, I never seen nothin' like that before and I've been putting in septic tanks for 20 years.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-Dear employee: As a result of the reduction of money budgeted for all department areas, we are forced to cut down on our number of personnel. Under this plan, older employees will be asked to take early retirement, thus permitting the retention of younger people who represent our future. Therefore, a program to phase out older personnel by the end of the next fiscal year, via retirement, will be placed into effect immediately. This program will be known as S.L.A.P. (Severance of Late+AC0-Aged Personnel). Employees who are SLAPPED will be given the opportunity to look for jobs outside the company. SLAPPED employees can request a review of their employment records before actual retirement takes place. This review phase of the program will be called S.C.R.E.W. (Survey of Capabilities of Retired Elderly Workers). All employees who have been SLAPPED and SCREWED may file an appeal with upper management. This appeal is called S.H.A.F.T. (Study by Higher Authority Following Termination). Under the terms of the new policy, an employee may be SLAPPED once, SCREWED twice, but may be SHAFTED as many times as the company deems appropriate. If an employee follows the above procedure, he/she will be entitled to get HE.R.P.E.S. (Half Earnings for Retired Personnel's Early Severance) or CLAP (Combined Lump sum Assistance Payment). As H.E.R.P.E.S. and C.L.A.P. are considered benefit plans, any employee who has received H.E.R.P.E.S . ALTERNATIVELY, C.L.A.P. will no longer be SLAPPED or SCREWED by the company. Management wishes to assure the younger employees who remain on board that the company will continue its policy of training employees through our: Special High Intensity Training ( S.H.I.T.). We take pride in the amount of S.H.I.T . our employees receive. We have given our employees more S.H.I.T. than any company in this area. If any employee feels they do not receive enough S.H.I.T. on the job, see your immediate supervisor. Your supervisor is specially trained to make sure you receive all the S.H.IT . you can stand. And, once again, thanks for all your years of loyal service with us+ACE- The Management+ACI-

+ACI-I used to eat a lot of natural foods until I learned that most people die of natural causes. Gardening Rule: When weeding, the best way to make sure you are removing a weed and not a valuable plant is to pull on it. If it comes out of the ground easily, it is a valuable plant. The easiest way to find something lost around the house is to buy a replacement. Never take life seriously. Nobody gets out alive anyway. There are two kinds of pedestrians: the quick and the dead. Life is sexually transmitted An unbreakable toy is useful for breaking other toys. If quitters never win, and winners never quit, then who is the fool who said, +ACIAIg-Quit while you're ahead?+ACIAIg- Health is merely the slowest possible rate at which one can die The only difference between a rut and a grave is the depth. Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day+ADs- teach that person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks. Some people are like Slinkies . . . not really good for anything, but you still can't help but smile when you see one tumble down the stairs. Health nuts are going to feel stupid someday, lying in hospitals dying of nothing. Have you noticed since everyone has a camcorder these days no one talks about seeing UFOs like they used to? Whenever I feel blue, I start breathing again. All of us could take a lesson from the weather. It pays no attention to criticism. Why does a slight tax increase cost you two hundred dollars and a substantial tax cut saves you thirty cents? In the 60's, people took acid to make the world weird. Now the world is weird and people take Prozac to make it normal. Politics is supposed to be the second oldest profession. I have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first. How is it one careless match can start a forest fire, but it takes a whole box to start a campfire?

So he looks in the yellow pages and sure enough, there's an ad for +ACIAIg-Gorilla Removers.+ACIAIg- He calls the number, and the gorilla remover says he'll be over in 30 minutes. The gorilla remover arrives, and gets out of his van. He's got a ladder, a baseball bat, a shotgun and a mean old pit bull. +ACIAIg-What are you going to do,+ACIAIg- the homeowner asks? +ACIAIg-I'm going to put this ladder up against the roof, then I'm going to go up there and knock the gorilla off the roof with this baseball bat. When the gorilla falls off, the pit bull is trained to grab his testicles and not let go. The gorilla will then be subdued enough for me to put him in the cage in the back of the van.+ACIAIg- He hands the shotgun to the homeowner. +ACIAIg-What's the shotgun for?+ACIAIg- asks the homeowner. +ACIAIg-If the gorilla knocks me off the roof, shoot the dog+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

You see all these washing machines are white and you don't sell black washing machines so you're a racist+ACEAIgAi- The manager, thinking quickly replied, +ACIAIg-Yes Mr. Jackson all the washing machines we carry are white... but if you open the lid you'll see that all the agitators are black.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

The doctor turns to the wife. +ACIAIg-Are you using the diaphragm that I prescribed?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Yes, I am,+ACIAIg- she replied. +ACIAIg-And what kind of jelly are you using with it?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Grape+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-A retired corporate executive, now a widower, decided to take a vacation. He booked himself on a Caribbean cruise and proceeded to have the time of his life, that is, until the ship sank. He found himself on an island with no other people, no supplies, nothing, only bananas and coconuts. After about four months, he is lying on the beach one day when the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen rows up to the shore. In disbelief, he asks, +ACIAIg-Where did you come from? How did you get here?+ACIAIg- She replies, +ACIAIg-I rowed from the other side of the island. I landed here when my cruise ship sank.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Amazing,+ACIAIg- he notes. +ACIAIg-You were really lucky to have a row boat wash up with you.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Oh, this thing?+ACIAIg- explains the woman. +ACIAIg-I made the boat out of raw material I found on the island. The oars were whittled from gum tree branches. I wove the bottom from palm branches, and the sides and stern came from a Eucalyptus tree.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-But, where did you get the tools?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Oh, that was no problem,+ACIAIg- replied the woman. +ACIAIg-On the south side of the island, a very unusual stratum of alluvial rock is exposed. I found if I fired it to a certain temperature in my kiln, it melted into ductile iron. I used that for tools and used the tools to make the hardware.+ACIAIg- The guy is stunned. +ACIAIg-Let's row over to my place,+ACIAIg- she says. After a few minutes of rowing, she docks the boat at a small wharf. As the man looks to shore, he nearly falls off the boat. Before him is a stone walk leading to an exquisite bungalow painted in blue and white While the woman ties up the rowboat wit h an expertly woven hemp rope, the man can only stare ahead, dumb struck. As they walk into the house, she says casually, +ACIAIg-It's not much, but I call it home. Sit down, please. Would you like a drink?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No+ACE- No thank you,+ACIAIg- he blurts out, still dazed. +ACIAIg-I can't take another drop of coconut juice.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-It's not coconut juice,+ACIAIg- winks the woman. +ACIAIg-I have a still. How would you like a Pina Colada?+ACIAIg- Trying to hide his continued amazement, the man accepts, and they sit down on her couch to talk. After they have exchanged their stories, the woman announces, +ACIAIg-I'm going to slip into something more comfortable. Would you like to take a shower and shave? There is a razor upstairs in the bathroom cabinet.+ACIAIg- No longer questioning anything, the man goes into the bathroom. There, in the cabinet, a razor made from a piece of tortoise bone. Two shells honed to a hollow ground edge are fastened on to its end inside a swivel mechanism. +ACIAIg-This woman is amazing,+ACIAIg- he muses. +ACIAIg-What next?+ACIAIg- When he returns, she greets him wearing nothing but vines, strategically positioned, and smelling faintly of gardenias. She beckons for him to sit down next to her. +ACIAIg-Tell me,+ACIAIg- she begins suggestively, slithering closer to him, +ACIAIg-We've been out here for many months. You've been lonely. There's something I'm sure you really feel like doing right now, something you've been longing for?+ACIAIg- She stares into his eyes. He can't believe what he's hearing. +ACIAIg-You mean . . he swallows excitedly and tears start to form in his eyes.+ACIAIg- . . . +ACIAIg-Don't tell me you've built a Golf Course+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

+ACI-When NASA was preparing for the Apollo Project, it took the astronauts to a Navajo reservation in Arizona for training. One day, a Navajo elder and his son came across the space crew walking among the rocks. The elder, who spoke only Navajo, asked a question. His son translated for the NASA people: +ACIAIg-What are these guys in the big suits doing?+ACIAIg- One of the astronauts said that they were practicing for a trip to the moon. When his son relayed this comment the Navajo elder got all excited and asked if it would be possible to give to the astronauts a message to deliver to the moon. Recognizing a promotional opportunity when he saw one, a NASA official accompanying the astronauts said, +ACIAIg-Why certainly+ACEAIgAi- and told an underling to get a tape recorder. The Navajo elder's comments into the microphone were brief. The NASA official asked the son if he would translate what his father had said. The son listened to the recording and laughed uproariously. But he refused to translate. So the NASA people took the tape to a nearby Navajo village and played it for other members of the tribe. They too laughed long and loudly but also refused to translate the elder's message to the moon. Finally, an official government translator was summoned. After he finally stopped laughing the translator relayed the message: +ACIAIg-Watch out for these assh+ACo-les. They have come to steal your land.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-THE VALUE OF UNDIES+AC0ALQ- Always wear clean underwear in public, especially when working under your vehicle... From the NORTHWEST FLORIDA Daily News comes this story of a Crestview couple who drove their car to Wal+ACo-Mart, only to have their car break down in the parking lot. The man told his wife to carry on with the shopping while he fixed the car in the lot. The wife returned later to see a small group of people near the car. On closer inspection, she saw a pair of male legs protruding from under the chassis. Although the man was in shorts, his lack of underpants turned private parts into glaringly public ones. Unable to stand the embarrassment, she dutifully stepped forward, quickly put her hand UP his shorts, and tucked everything back into place. On regaining her feet, she looked across the hood and found herself staring at her husband who was standing idly by. The mechanic, however, had to have three stitches in his forehead.+ACI-

+ACI-A US Air Force C+AC0-141 was scheduled to leave Thule Air Base, Greenland at midnight. During the pilot's preflight check, he discovered that the aircraft's latrine holding tank was still full from the last flight. So a message was sent to the base, and an airman who was off duty is called out to take care of it. The young man finally got to the air base and made his way to the aircraft, only to find that the latrine pump truck had been left outdoors and was frozen solid, so he had to find another one in the hangar, which takes even more time. He returned to the aircraft and was less than enthusiastic about what he had to do. Nevertheless, he went about the pumping job deliberately and carefully (and slowly) so as to not risk criticism later. As he's left the plane, the pilot stopped him and said, +ACIAIg-Son, your attitude and performance has caused this flight to be late, and I'm going to personally see to it that you are not just reprimanded, but punished.+ACIAIg- Shivering in the cold, his task finished, the airman took a deep breath, stood up tall and said, +ACIAIg-Sir, with all due respect, I'm not your son+ADs- I'm an Airman in the United States Air Force.

I was feeling particularly sassy that day because I had just came from a thrilling choir performance, followed by a thunderous prayer meeting. So, I bought the sticker and put it on my bumper. Boy, am I glad I did, what an uplifting experience that followed. I was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord and how good he is, and I didn't notice that the light had changed. It is a good thing someone else loves Jesus because if he hadn't honked, I'd never have noticed. I found that lots of people love Jesus+ACE- While I was sitting there, the guy behind started honking like crazy, and then he leaned out of his window and screamed, For the lov e of God+ACE- Go+ACE- Go+ACE- Go+ACE- Jesus Christ, GO+ACE- What an exuberant cheerleader he was for Jesus+ACE- Everyone started honking+ACE- I just leaned out my window and started waving and smiling at all those loving people.

My grandson burst out laughing. Why even he was enjoying this religious experience+ACEAIQ- A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started walking towards me. I bet they wanted to pray or ask what church I attended, but this is when I noticed the light had changed. So, I waved at all my brothers and sisters grinning, and drove on through the intersection. I noticed that I was the only car that got through the intersection before the light changed again and felt kind of sad that I had to leave them after all the love we had shared. So I slowed the car down, leaned out the window and gave them all the Hawaiian good luck sign one last time as I drove away. Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks+ACEAIQ- Will write again soon, Love, Grandma+ACI-

+ACI-Basic Rules for Dogs Who Have a Yard To Protect NEWSPAPERS: If you have to go to the bathroom while playing in the front yard, always use the newspaper that's placed in the driveway every morning for that purpose. VISITORS: Quickly determine which guest is afraid of dogs. Charge across the room, barking loudly and leap playfully on this person. If the human falls down on the floor and starts crying, lick its face and growl gently to show your concern. BARKING: Because you are a dog, you are expected to bark. So bark+AC0ALQAt- a lot. Your owners will be very happy to hear you protecting their house. Especially late at night while they are sleeping safely in their beds. There is no more secure feeling for a human than to keep waking up in the middle of the night and hearing your protective bark, bark, bark... LICKING: Always take a BIG drink from your water dish immediately before licking your human. Humans prefer clean tongues. Be ready to fetch your human a towel. HOLES: Rather than digging a BIG hole in the middle of the yard and upsetting your human, dig a lot of smaller holes all over the yard so they won't notice. If you arrange a little pile of dirt on one side of each hole, maybe they'll think it's gophers. There are never enough holes in the ground. Strive daily to do your part to help correct this problem. DOORS: The area directly in front of a door is always reserved for the family dog to sleep. THE ART OF SNIFFING: Humans like to be sniffed. Everywhere. It is your duty, as the family dog, to accommodate them. DINING ETIQUETTE: Always sit under the table at dinner, especially when there are guests, so you can clean up any food that falls on the floor. It's also a good time to practice your sniffing. HOUSEBREAKING: Housebreaking is very important to humans, so break as much of the house as possible.

+ACI-Never before had Sue looked in the box that her husband Fred kept under their bed. The box had been there for the past 20 years of their marriage but she had never invaded his privacy. One day, while cleaning, she decided to take a look in the box. She didn't figure it was anything he was hiding since she could have looked at it any other time but hadn't. In the box she found 3 eggs and 10 thousand dollars. This seemed very strange so she went to Fred and asked, 'Why are there 3 eggs in a box under our bed?' He replied, 'Well, every time I was unfaithful to you, I put an egg in the box.' Sue was surprised and hurt that he had been unfaithful but she consoled herself with the fact that they had been married for over 20 years and he had only been unfaithful 3 times. 'But where did the 10 thousand dollars come from?' she asked. 'Every time I got a dozen, I sold it.'+ACI-

My captors continued to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while I am forced to eat dry cereal. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of escape, and the mild satisfaction I get from clawing the furniture. Tomorrow I may eat another house plant. Today my attempt to kill my captors by winding around their feet while they were walking almost succeeded. Must try this at the top of the stairs. In an attempt to disgust and repulse these vile oppressors, I once again induced myself to vomit on their favorite chair. Must try this on their bed. Decapitated a mouse and brought them the headless body in an attempt to make them aware of what I am capable of, and to try to strike fear in their hearts. They only cooed and condescended about what a good little cat I was. Hmmm, not working according to plan. There was some sort of gathering of their accomplices. I was placed in solitary throughout the event. However, I could hear the noise and smell the food. More important, I overheard that my confinement was due to my powers of inducing +ACIAIg-allergies.+ACIAIg- Must learn what this is and how to use it to my advantage.

People were crowding around four and five deep, pushing to get a good look.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Four and five deep?+ACIAIg- asked Mrs. Smith, eyes widened in amazement. +ACIAIg-Yes+ACIAIg-, the photographer said. +ACIAIg-And for more than three hours, too.

+ACI-PARIS HILTON CALLS FOR END TO SWIFT BOAT FLAP Says It's drawing Attention Away From Her Hotel heiress and reality TV star Paris Hilton today called for an end to the controversy over Sen John Kerry's Vietnam War service, warning that the continuing swift boat flap was drawing attention away from her.

Ms. Hilton picked up an important backer later in the day when actress Lindsay Lohan voiced her support for the tabloid princess's decision to take on the swift boat veterans. +ACIAIg-Before the whole swift boat thing came up, people were obsessed with whether or not I had my breasts augmented,+ACIAIg- Ms. Lohan said. +ACIAIg-I'm deeply concerned that the nation seems to have lost focus on that.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-If these swift boat veterans were really for truth, they'd want to know the facts about my boobs,+ACIAIg- she added.

+ACI-Two men contracted to paint a small community church. Being very frugal(cheap), they pinched and scraped to spend the absolute minimum onmaterials.

Not wishing to spend any more money if they didn't absolutely have to,they decided they would just dilute the water+AC0-based paint they were using sothat it would last longer. They did this a couple more times before theyfinished, which caused striping on the church as the paint got lighter eachtime it was thinned. The painters had just about gotten to the top of thesteeple, when, all of a sudden, the sky darkened, and the rain started topour down. As the paint streamed down the sides of the church, a voiceboomed from the heavens: +ACIAIg-Repaint, you thinners+ACE- Repaint, and thin no more+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

+ACI-Bill had always been a prankster. As each of his friends were married, Bill made sure some type of practical joke was played upon them. Now ready to be married himself, he was dreading the payback he knew was coming. Surprisingly, the ceremony went off without a hitch. No one stood up during the pause to offer a reason 'why this couple should not be married'. His reception wasn't disrupted by streakers or strippers, and the car the couple was to take on their honeymoon was in perfect working order. When the couple arrived at their hotel and entered the room, Bill even checked for cornflakes in the bed (a gag he had always loved). Nothing, it seemed, was amiss. Satisfied that he had come away unscathed, the couple fell into bed and put their attention to consummating the union. Upon waking after such an active night, the couple was ravenous so Bill called down to room service and asked +ACIAIg-Can I get breakfast for two?+ACIAIg-. Before he was able to hang up, however, a soft voice from under the bed said +ACIAIg-Make that five...+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-MIDDLETOWN, Ohio (AP) +AC0- The city's tax superintendent has been suspended without pay for a week for trying to inject some humor in the city income tax filing instructions.

+ACI-The bartender was washing his glasses, when an elderly Irishman came in. With great difficulty, the Irishman hoisted his bad leg over the barstool, pulled himself up painfully and asked for a sip of Irish whiskey. The Irishman looked down the bar and said, +ACIAIg-Is that Jesus down there?+ACIAIg- The bartender nodded, so the Irishman told him to give Jesus an Irish whiskey, too. The next patron to come in was an ailing Italian with a hunched back, who moved very slow. He shuffled up to the barstool and asked for a glass of Chianti. He also looked down the bar and asked if that was Jesus sitting at the end of the bar. The bartender nodded, so the Italian said to give Him a glass of Chianti, too. The third patron to enter the bar was a redneck, who swaggered into the bar and hollered, +ACIAIg-Barkeep, set me up a cold one+ACE- Hey, is that God's Boy down there?+ACIAIg- The barkeep nodded, so the redneck told him to give Jesus a cold one, too. As Jesus got up to leave, he walked over to the Irishman and touched him and said, +ACIAIg-For your kindness, you are healed+ACEAIgAi- The Irishman felt the strength come back to his leg, so he got up and danced a jig out the door. Jesus touched the Italian and said, +ACIAIg-For your kindness, you are healed+ACEAIgAi- The Italian felt his back straighten, so he raised his hands above his head and did a flip out the door.

+ACI-After watching sales falling off for three straight months at Kentucky Fried Chicken, the Colonel calls up the Pope and asks for a favor. The Pope says, +ACIAIg-What can I do?+ACIAIg- The Colonel says, +ACIAIg-I need you to change the daily prayer from, 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily chicken'. If you do it, I'll donate +ACQ-10 Million Dollars to the Vatican.+ACIAIg- The Pope replies, +ACIAIg-I am very sorry. That is the Lord's prayer and I can not change the words.+ACIAIg- So the Colonel hangs up. After another month of dismal sales, the Colonel panics, and calls again. +ACIAIg-Listen your Excellency. I really need your help. I'll donate +ACQ-50 million dollars if you change the words of the daily prayer from 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily chicken.'+ACIAIg- And the Pope responds, +ACIAIg-It is very tempting, Colonel Sanders. The church could do a lot of good with that much money. It would help us to support many charities. But, again, I must decline. It is the Lord's prayer, and I can't change the words.+ACIAIg- So the Colonel gives up again. After two more months of terrible sales, the Colonel gets desperate. +ACIAIg-This is my final offer, your Excellency. If you change the words of the daily prayer from, 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily chicken' I will donate +ACQ-100 million to the Vatican.+ACIAIg- The Pope replies, +ACIAIg-Let me get back to you.+ACIAIg- So the next day, the Pope calls together all of his bishops and he says, +ACIAIg-I have some good news and I have some bad news. The good news is that KFC is going to donate +ACQ-100 million to the Vatican.+ACIAIg- The bishops rejoice at the news. Then one asks about the bad news. The Pope replies, +ACIAIg-The bad news is that we lost the Wonder Bread account.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-Once upon a time there were two little skunks named +ACIAIg-In+ACIAIg- and +ACIAIg-Out.+ACIAIg- They lived in a hollow tree with their mother. Sometime In and Out played outside, but other times they played inside. One day In was out and Out was in. Mother skunk told Out to go out and bring In in.

+ACI-The power mower was broken and wouldn't run. A lady kept hinting to her husband that he should get it fixed, but somehow the message never sank in. Finally she thought of a clever way to make her point. When her husband arrived home one day, he found her seated in the tall grass, busily snipping away with a tiny pair of sewing scissors. He watched silently for a short time and then went into the house. He was gone only a few moments. When he came out again, he handed her a toothbrush. +ACIAIg-When you finish cutting the grass,+ACIAIg- he said, +ACIAIg-You might as well sweep the sidewalks.+ACIAIg- The doctors say he will probably walk again, but he will always limp.+ACI-

The voice once again calls out +ACIAIg-One man from Texas is better than one hundred Iraqi.+ACIAIg- Furious, the Iraqi commander sends his next best 100 troops over the dune and instantly a huge gun fight commences. After 10 minutes of battle, again, silence. The Rebel voice calls out again +ACIAIg-One man from Texas is better than one thousand Iraqi.+ACIAIg- The enraged Iraqi commander musters 1000 fighters and sends them to the other side of the dune. Rifle fire, machine guns, grenades, rockets and cannon fire ring out as a terrible battle is fought.... Then silence. Eventually one badly wounded Iraqi fighter crawls back over the dune and with his dying words tells his commander, +ACIAIg-Don't send any more men...it's a trap. There are two of them.+ACI-

+ACI-This is true +ACEAIQ- It details what to do if an anaconda attacks you. Excerpt is from the US Government Peace Corps Manual for volunteers working in the Amazon Jungle. Related to the boa constrictor, the anaconda is the largest snake species in the world. It grows to thirty+AC0-five feet in length and weighs 300 to 400 pounds. 1. If you are attacked by an anaconda, do not run. The snake is faster than you are. 2. Lie flat on the ground. Put your arms tight against your sides, your legs tight against one another. 3. Tuck your chin in. 4. The snake will begin to nudge and climb over your body. 5. Do not panic. 6. After the snake has examined you, it will begin to swallow you from the feet end +AC0- always from the feet end. Permit the snake to swallow your feet and ankles. Do not panic+ACE- 7. The snake will now begin to suck your legs into its body. You must lie perfectly still. This will take a long time. 8. When the snake has reached your knees, slowly and with as little movement as possible, reach down, take your knife and very gently slide it into the side of the snake's mouth between the edge of its mouth and your leg, then suddenly rip upwards, severing the snake's head. 9. Be sure you have your knife. 10. Be sure your knife is sharp.+ACI-

And the third. By the time the fourth song came on, the groom ran up and kicked the bride between the legs. A riot broke out, and all the invited guests were hauled off to jail.

+ACI-In California Unleaded gas went to +ACQ-4.00 a gallon last Thursday. Sister Mary Ann, who worked for a home health agency, was out making her rounds visiting homebound patients when she ran out of gas. Fortunately, an Exxon station was just a block away. She walked to the station to borrow a gas can and buy some gas. The attendant told her that the only gas can he owned had been loaned out, but she could wait until it was returned. Since Sister Mary Ann was on the way to see a patient, she decided not to wait, and walked back to her car. She looked for something in her car that she could fill with gas, and spotted the bedpan she was taking to the patient. Always resourceful, Sister Mary Ann carried the bedpan to the station, filled it with gasoline, and carried the full bedpan back to her car. As she was pouring the gas into her tank, two Baptist ladies watched from across the street. One of them turned to the other and said, 'If it starts, I'm turning Catholic.'+ACI-

+ACI-In the hospital the relatives gathered in the waiting room where their family member lay gravely ill. Finally, the doctor came in looking tired and somber. +ACIAIg-I'm afraid I'm the bearer of bad news,+ACIAIg- he said as he surveyed the worried faces. +ACIAIg-The only hope left for your loved one at this time is a brain transplant. It's an experimental procedure, semi+AC0-risky and you will have to pay for the brain yourselves.+ACIAIg- The family members sat silent as they absorbed the news. After a great length of time, someone asked,+ACIAIg-Well, how much does a brain cost?+ACIAIg- The doctor quickly responded, +ACIAIgAk-5,000 for a male brain, and +ACQ-200 for a female brain.+ACIAIg- The moment turned awkward. Men in the room tried not to smile, avoiding eye contact with the women, but some actually smirked. A man, unable to control his curiosity, blurted out the question everyone wanted to ask. +ACIAIg-Why is the male brain so much more?+ACIAIg- The doctor smiled at the childish innocence and said, +ACIAIg-It's just standard pricing procedure. We have to mark down the price of the female brains, because they've actually been used.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-Once upon a time there was a non+AC0-conforming sparrow who decided not to fly south for the winter. However, soon the weather turned so cold that he reluctantly decided to fly south. In a short time ice began to form on his wings and he fell to Earth in a barnyard, nearly frozen solid. A cow passed by where he had fallen, and crapped on the little sparrow.The sparrow thought it was the end, but the manure warmed him and defrosted his wings+ACE- Warm and happy, able to breath, he started to sing. Just then a large cat came by, and hearing the chirping he investigated the sounds. The cat cleared away the manure, found the chirping bird, and promptly ate him. The Moral of the Story: Everyone who craps on you is not necessarily your enemy Everyone who gets you out of crap is not necessarily your friend. And if you're warm and happy in a pile of crap, you might just want to keep your mouth shut.+ACI-
+ACI-A gentleman walks into a bank in New York City and asks for the loan officer. He says he is going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to borrow +ACQ-5,000. The bank officer says the bank will need some kind of security for such a loan. So the gentleman hands over the keys to a new Rolls Royce parked on the street in front of the bank. Everything checks out, and the bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. An employee drives the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the gentleman returns, repays the +ACQ-5,000 and the interest, which comes to +ACQ-15.41. The loan officer says, +ACIAIg-We are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is why would you bother to borrow +ACQ-5,000?+ACIAIg- The gentleman replied, +ACIAIg-Where else in New York can I park my car for two weeks for 15 bucks?+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-King Arthur was in Merlin's laboratory where the great wizard was showing him his latest creation. It was a chastity belt, except it had a rather large hole in the most obvious place, which made it basically useless. +ACIAIg-This is no good, Merlin+ACEAIgAi- the King exclaimed, +ACIAIg-Look at this opening. How is this supposed to protect my lady, the Queen, when I'm on a long quest?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Ah, sire, just observe, +ACIAIg- said Merlin. He then selected his most worn out wand, one that he was going to discard anyway. He inserted it in the gaping aperture of the chastity belt whereupon a small guillotine blade came down and cut it neatly in two. +ACIAIg-Merlin, you are a genius+ACEAIgAi- said the grateful monarch. +ACIAIg-Now I can leave, knowing that my Queen is fully protected.+ACIAIg- After putting Guinevere in the device, King Arthur then set out upon a lengthy Quest. Several years passed until he returned to Camelot. Immediately he assembled all of his knights in the courtyard and had them drop their trousers for an informal 'short arm' inspection. Sure enough, each and every one of them was either amputated or damaged in some way, everyone of them except, Sir Galahad. +ACIAIg-Sir Galahad, +ACIAIg- exclaimed King Arthur. +ACIAIg-You are my one and only true knight+ACE- Only you among all the nobles have been true to me. Whatever it is in my power to grant you? Name it and it is yours.+ACIAIg- But, alas, Sir Galahad was speechless........+ACI-

+ACI-A man goes into a store and asks the clerk for some +ACIAIg-Polish Sausage.+ACIAIg- The clerk looked at him and asked +ACIAIg-Are you Polish?+ACIAIg- The guy, clearly offended, says +ACIAIg-Well, yes I am. But let me ask you something. If I asked you for Italian Sausage, would you ask me if I was Italian? Or, if I asked for German Bratwurst, would you ask me if I was German? Or if I asked you for a Kosher Hot Dog, would you ask me if I was Jewish? Or, if I asked you for a Taco, would you ask me if I was Mexican? Would ya, huh? Would ya?+ACIAIg- The clerk says, +ACIAIg-Well no.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-And if I asked you for some Irish Whiskey, would you ask me if I was Irish? What about Canadian Bacon, would you ask me if I was Canadian?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Well, I probably wouldn't,+ACIAIg- With self+AC0-indignation, the guy says, +ACIAIg-Well, all right then, why did you ask me if I'm Polish just because I asked for Polish Sausage?' The clerk replies, +ACIAIg-Because you're at Home Depot.+ACI-
+ACI-After a night on the town, a young woman brought a new friend home for a late+AC0-night drink. +ACIAIg-You can't make any noise,+ACIAIg- she warned him. +ACIAIg-My parents are upstairs and if they find out they'll kill us.+ACIAIg- Things started getting heated on the sofa, but after a while alcohol got the better of the man. +ACIAIg-I have to go,+ACIAIg- he said. +ACIAIg-Well you can't go upstairs. The bathroom is right next to my parents' bedroom,+ACIAIg- she replied. +ACIAIg-Use the kitchen sink.+ACIAIg- So he dutifully retired to the kitchen. A few minutes later, he popped his head around the door and asked, +ACIAIg-Do you have any toilet paper, or should I just use a paper towel?+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-Mildred, the church gossip, and self+AC0-appointed monitor of the church's morals, kept sticking her nose into other people's business. Several members did not approve of her extra+AC0-curricular activities, but feared her enough to maintain their silence. She made a mistake, however, when she accused George, a new member, of being an alcoholic after she saw his old pickup parked in front of the town's only bar one afternoon. She emphatically told George and several others that everyone seeing it there would know what he was doing. George, a man of few words, stared at her for a moment and just turned and walked away. He didn't explain, defend, or deny. He said nothing. Later that evening, George quietly parked his pickup in front of Mildred's house... and left it there all night.+ACI-
+ACI-I know you have an interest in poker +AC0- here's a twist. Two couples were playing cards one evening. John accidentally dropped some cards on the floor. When he bent down under the table to pick them up, he noticed that Bill's wife Sue, legs spread wide, wasn't wearing any underwear+ACE- Shocked by this, John upon trying to sit back up again, hit his head on the table and emerged red+AC0-faced. Later, John went to the kitchen to get some refreshments. Bill's wife followed and asked, +ACIAIg-Did you see anything that you liked under there?+ACIAIg- Surprised by her boldness, John courageously admitted that, well, indeed he did. She said, +ACIAIg-Well, you can have it but it will cost you +ACQ-500.+ACIAIg- After taking a minute or two to assess the financial as well as the moral costs of this offer, John indicates that he is indeed interested. She tells him that since her husband, Bill, works Friday afternoons and John doesn't, that John should be at her house around 2:00 PM Friday afternoon. When Friday rolled around, John showed up at Bill's house for the planned time with Sue at 2:00 PM sharp and after paying her the agreed sum of +ACQ-500, they went to the bedroom and closed their sexual transaction as Sue had promised. Afterwards, John quickly dressed and left. As usual, Bill came home from work at 6:00 PM and upon entering the house, asked his wife abruptly, +ACIAIg-Did John come by the house this afternoon?+ACIAIg- A little worried, Bill's wife answered, +ACIAIg-Why yes, he did stop by for a few minutes this afternoon?+ACIAIg- Her heart nearly skipped a beat when her husband curtly asked, +ACIAIg-And did he give you +ACQ-500?+ACIAIg- In terror, she assumed that somehow he had found out, and after ushering up her best poker face, replied, +ACIAIg-Well, yes, in fact he did give me +ACQ-500.+ACIAIg- Bill, with a satisfied look on his face, surprised his wife by saying, +ACIAIg-Good I was hoping he did. John came by the office this morning and borrowed +ACQ-500 from me. He promised me he'd stop by our house this afternoon on his way home and pay me back.+ACIAIg- NOW THAT'S A POKER PLAYER+ACE-+ACI-
+ACI-A cowboy walks into a bar in Texas, orders three mugs of beer and sits in the back room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn. When he finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three more. The bartender approaches and tells him, +ACIAIg-You know, a mug goes flat after I draw it, it would taste better if you bought one at a time.+ACIAIg- The cowboy replies, +ACIAIg-Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is in Australia, the other is in Dublin, and I'm in Texas. When we all left home, we promised that we'd drink this way to remember the days we drank together. So I drink one for each o' my brothers and one for myself.+ACIAIg- The bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there. The cowboy becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way. He orders three mugs and drinks them in turn. One day, he comes in and orders two mugs.

She and I have been married 30 years, she's a wonderful wife and mother, but, she has never offered much excitement in the bedroom, so I used to fool around with women a lot.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Susan is actually your half sister, and I'm afraid you can't marry her.+ACIAIg- George was brokenhearted. After eight months he eventually started dating girls again. A year later he came home and very proudly announced, +ACIAIg-Diane said yes+ACE- We're getting married in June.+ACIAIg- Again his father insisted on another private conversation and broke the sad news. +ACIAIg-Diane is your half sister too, George. +ACIAIg-I'm awfully sorry about this.+ACIAIg- George was livid+ACE- He finally decided to go to his mother with the news his father had shared. +ACIAIg-Dad has done so much harm.

Everyone agreed that was good. Then the three men turned to the Government Employee and said, +ACIAIg-What can your cat do?+ACIAIg- The Government Worker called to his cat and said, +ACIAIg-Coffee Break, do your stuff.+ACIAIg- Coffee Break jumped to his feet, ate the cookies, drank the milk, crapped on the paper, screwed the other three cats, claimed he injured his back while doing so, filed a grievance report for unsafe working conditions, put in for Workers Compensation and went home for the rest of the day on sick leave.+ACI-

+ACI-According to a news report, a certain private school in Washington recently was faced with a unique problem. A number of 12+AC0-year+AC0-old girls were beginning to use lipstick and would put it on in the bathroom. That was fine, but after they put on their lipstick they would press their lips to the mirror leaving dozens of little lip prints. Every night, the maintenance man would remove them and the next day, the girls would put them back. Finally the principal decided that something had to be done. She called all the girls to the bathroom and met them there with the maintenance man....She explained that all these lip prints were causing a major problem for the custodian who had to clean the mirrors every night. To demonstrate how difficult it had been to clean the mirrors, she asked the maintenance man to show the girls how much effort was required. He took out a long+AC0-handled squeegee, dipped it in the toilet, and cleaned the mirror with it. Since then, there have been no lip prints on the mirror. There are teachers, and then there are educators...+ACI-

+ACI-Take Care of the Big Rocks First A philosophy professor stood before his class and had some items in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly he picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks, rocks about 2+ACIAIg- in diameter. He then asked the students if the jar was full? They agreed that it was. So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas between the rocks. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was. The professor picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. He then asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with an unanimous +AC0- yes. The professor then produced two cans of beer from under the table and proceeded to pour their entire contents into the jar +AC0- effectively filling the empty space between the sand. The students laughed. +ACIAIg-Now,+ACIAIg- said the professor, as the laughter subsided, +ACIAIg-I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life. The rocks are the important things +AC0- your family, your partner, your health, and your children +AC0- Things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full. The pebbles are the other things that matter, like your job, your house, and your car. The sand is everything else. The small stuff.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-If you put the sand into the jar first,+ACIAIg- he continued, +ACIAIg-there is no room for the pebbles or the rocks. The same goes for your life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your partner out dancing. There will always be time to go to work, give a dinner party and fix the disposal. +ACIAIg-Take care of the rocks first, the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.+ACIAIg- One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the beer represented. The professor smiled. +ACIAIg-I'm glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for a couple of beers.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-After having dug to a depth of 10 feet last year, New York scientists found traces of copper wire dating back 100 years and came to the conclusion, that their ancestors already had a telephone network more than 100 years ago.

He thought, +ACIAIg-I better open this one and see what it's all about.+ACIAIg- So he opened it and it read: +ACIAIg-Dear God, I am an 83 year old widow living on a very small pension. Yesterday someone stole my purse.

Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-I have no family to turn to, and you are my only hope. Can you please help me?+ACIAIg- The postal worker was touched, and went around showing the letter to all the others. Each of them dug into his wallet and came up with a few dollars. By the time he made the rounds, he had collected 96 dollars, which they put into an envelope and sent over to her. The rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm glow thinking of the nice thing they had done. Easter came and went, and a few days later came another letter from the old lady to God. All the workers gathered around while the letter was opened. It read: +ACIAIg-Dear God, How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Because of your generosity, I was able to fix a lovely dinner for my friends. We had a very nice day, and I told my friends of your wonderful gift. +ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-By the way, there was 4 dollars missing.

He telephoned an emergency Gorilla Removal Service, and shortly a technician arrived with a stick, a pair of hand cuffs, a tiny Chihuahua, and a shotgun. +ACIAIg-Now listen carefully,+ACIAIg- he told the homeowner. +ACIAIg-I am going to climb the tree, and poke the Gorilla with this stick, until he falls to the ground. My trained Chihuahua will go right for the Gorilla's testicles, and when the Gorilla instinctively crosses his hands over his testicles to protect himself, you slap on the hand cuffs without delay.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-OK...got it,+ACIAIg- the homeowner replied. +ACIAIg-But what is the shotgun for?+ACIAIg- Said the technician....+ACIAIg-If I should fall out of the tree before the Gorilla......SHOOT the Chihuahua+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

+ACI-The Amazing Magical Snake Having arrived at the edge of the river, the fisherman soon realized he had forgotten to bring any bait. Just then he happened to see a little snake passing by who had caught a worm. The fisherman snatched up the snake and robbed him of his worm. Feeling sorry for the little snake with no lunch, he snatched him up again and poured a little beer down his throat and went about his fishing. An hour or so later the fisherman felt a tug at his pant leg. Looking down, he saw the same snake with three more worms.+ACI-

+ACI-When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend. When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion, so I decided I needed a passionate girl with a zest for life. In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything was an emergency+ADs- she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide. So I decided I needed a girl with stability. When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was totally predictable and never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I needed a girl with some excitement. When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her. She rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and very energetic, but directionless. So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition. When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly on the ground and married her. She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned. I am now older and wiser, and am looking for a girl with big tits.+ACI-
+ACI-While out one morning in the park, a jogger found a brand new tennis ball, and seeing none around it might belong to, he slipped it into the pocket of his shorts. Later, on his way home, he stopped at the pedestrian crossing, waiting for the lights to change. A Blonde Girl standing next to him eyed the large bulge in his shorts. +ACIAIg-What's that ?+ACIAIg- she asked, her eyes gleaming with lust. +ACIAIg-Tennis ball,+ACIAIg- came the breathless reply. +ACIAIg-Oh,+ACIAIg- said the Blonde Girl sympathetically, +ACIAIg-That must be painful....

How much will childbirth hurt?+ACIAIg- The doctor answered, +ACIAIg-Well, that varies from woman to woman and pregnancy to pregnancy and besides, it's difficult to describe pain.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-I know, but can't you give me some idea?,+ACIAIg- she asks. +ACIAIg-Grab your upper lip and pull it out a little...+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Like this?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-A little more...+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Like this?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No. A little more...+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Like this?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Yes.

+ACI-A rabbi, a priest and a pastor were all in a boat together fishing. The pastor said to the others, +ACIAIg-I think I am going to go over to that shore and sit down.+ACIAIg- So, he gets out of the boat, walks across the water and sits down on the shore. Then, the priest says to the rabbi, +ACIAIg-I think I going to go over there to join him.+ACIAIg- So, he does the same as the pastor and sits next to him on the shore. The rabbi thinks to himself, +ACIAIg-Well, if they can do it, so can I+ACEAIgAi- So, he climbs out of the boat, but he falls in the water.

+ACI-Deep In the back woods, a hillbilly's wife went into labor in the middle of the night, and the doctor was called out to assist in the delivery. Since there was no electricity, the doctor handed the father+AC0-to+AC0-be a lantern and said, +ACIAIg-Here. You hold this high so I can see what I am doing.+ACIAIg- Soon, a baby boy was brought into the world. Whoa there, said the doctor, +ACIAIg-Don't be in such a rush to put that lantern down. I think there's another one coming.+ACIAIg- Sure enough, within minutes he had delivered a baby girl. +ACIAIg-Hold that lantern up, don't set it down there's another one+ACEAIgAi- said the doctor. Within a few minutes he had delivered a third baby. +ACIAIg-No, don't be in a hurry to put down that lantern, it seems there's yet another one coming+ACEAIgAi- cried the doctor. The redneck scratched his head in bewilderment, and asked the doctor,+ACIAIg-You reckon it might be the light that's attractin' 'em?+ACI-

+ACI-My friend, the manager of a grocery store, nabbed a shoplifter in the act. He was escorting the suspect to the office in the front of the store (near the cash registers), when the shoplifter broke from his grip and tried to run. After a scuffle, my friend pinned him against the wall and looked up to see a number of surprised customers staring at him. +ACIAIg-Everything's fine, Folks,+ACIAIg- he reassured them. +ACIAIg-This guy just tried to go through the express line with more than ten items.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-A man owned a small farm in South Georgia.

+ACI-Dale Jarrett, Rusty Wallace and Robert Pressely found themselves in hell. They were a little confused at their present situation, and they were startled to see a door in the wall open, behind the door was perhaps the ugliest 1973 Pinto they had ever seen. It was multi+AC0-colored with plenty of rust and primer...dirty... dry+AC0-rotted interior..and you could smell it even over the Brimstone. The voice of the Devil was heard: +ACIAIg-Dale, YOU HAVE SINNED+ACEAIQAh- You are condemned to spend the rest of eternity in the drivers seat of this car+ACEAIQAhACIAIg- And Jarrett was whisked through the door by a group of lesser demons to his torment. This understandably shook up the other two, and so they both jumped when the second door opened...and they saw an even MORE disgusting example of automaking gone wrong. It was a 1978 Gremlin it was over smashed in every which direction, covered in thick hand paint+AC0-brushed house paint and lots of +ACIAIg-peace+ACIAIg- symbols and hippie colors. It has a top speed of 34, the electrics don't work, and the radio works but only plays the theme from +ACIAIg-Alice+ACIAIg- and you can't turn it off. The voice of the Devil was heard: +ACIAIg-Rusty, YOU HAVE SINNED+ACEAIQAh- You are condemned to spend the rest of eternity in the drivers seat of this car+ACEAIQAhACIAIg- And Rusty, like Jarrett before him, was whisked off. Robert Pressley, now alone, felt understandably anxious, and feared the worst...when the third door opened.... And as the door...inched...open...., he strained to see the figure of... a 1998 Dodge VIPER+ACEAIQAh- Delighted, Robert, taking in the sight of this beautiful piece of Automaking Delight, Shiney and powerful this car is made to run like hell. Then he heard the voice of the Devilsaying:... +ACIAIg-Viper, YOU HAVE SINNED....+ACI-
+ACI-Some of us Southerners are pretty skeptical of horoscopes and the people that read them. If we are to ever fully understand all the star signs and the people they represent, we need symbols that all true Southerners understand: See the list below... OKRA (Dec 22 +AC0- Jan 20) Are tough on the outside but tender on the inside. Okras have tremendous influence. An older Okra can look back over his life and see the seeds of his influence everywhere. You can do something good each day if you try. CHITLIN (Jan 21 +AC0- Feb 19) Chitlins come from humble backgrounds. A Chitlin, however, will make something of himself if he is motivated and has lots of seasoning. In dealing with Chitlins, be careful they may surprise you. They can erupt like Vesuvius. Chitlins are best with Catfish and Okra. BOLL WEEVIL (Feb 20 +AC0- March 20) You have an overwhelming curiosity. You're unsatisfied with the surface of things, and you feel the need to bore deep into the interior of everything. Needless to say, you are very intense and driven as if you had some inner hunger. You love to stay busy and tend to work too much. Nobody in their right mind is going to marry you, so don't worry about it. MOON PIE (March 21 +AC0- April 20) You're the type that spends a lot of time on the front porch. A cinch to recognize the physical appearance of Moon Pies. Big and round are the key words here. You should marry anybody who you can get remotely interested in the idea. It's not going to be easy. You always have a big smile and are happy. This might be the year to think about aerobics. Maybe not. POSSUM (April 21 +AC0- May 21) When confronted with life's difficulties, possums have a marked tendency to withdraw and develop a don't+AC0-bother+AC0-me+AC0-about+AC0-it attitude. Sometimes you become so withdrawn, people actually think you're dead. This strategy is probably not psychologically healthy but seems to work for you. You are a rare breed. Most folks love to watch you work and play. You are a night person and mind your own business. CRAWFISH (May 22 +AC0- June 21) Crawfish is a water sign. If you work in an office, you're hanging around the water cooler. Crawfish prefer the beach to the mountains, the pool to the golf course, and the bathtub to the living room. You tend not to be particularly attractive physically, but you have very, very good heads. COLLARDS (June 22 +AC0- July 23) Collards have a genius for communication. They love to get in the melting pot of life and share their essence with the essence of those around them. Collards make good social workers, psychologists, and baseball managers. As far as your personal life goes, if you are Collards, stay away from Crawfish. It just won't work. Save yourself a lot of heartache. CATFISH (July 24 +AC0- Aug 23) Catfish are traditionalists in matters of the heart, although one's whiskers may cause problems for loved ones. You Catfish are never easy people to understand. You run fast. You work and play hard. Even though you prefer the muddy bottoms to the clear surface of life, you are liked by most. Above all else, Catfish should stay away from Moon Pies. GRITS (Aug 24 +AC0- Sept 23) Your highest aim is to be with others like yourself. You like to huddle together with a big crowd of other Grits. You love to travel though, so maybe you should think about joining a club. Where do you like to go? Anywhere they have cheese, gravy, bacon, butter, or eggs and a good time. If you can go somewhere where they have all these things, that serves you well. You are pure in heart. BOILED PEANUTS (Sept 24 +AC0- Oct 23) You have a passionate desire to help your fellow man. Unfortunately, those who know you best, your friends and loved ones, may find that your personality is much too salty, and their criticism will affect you deeply because you are really much softer than you appear. You should go right ahead and marry anybody you want to because in a certain way, yours is a charmed life. On the road of life, you can be sure that people will always pull over and stop for you. BUTTER BEAN (Oct 24 +AC0- Nov 22) Always invite a Butter Bean to a party because Butter Beans get along well with everybody. You, as a Butter Bean, should be proud. You've grown on the vine of life, and you feel at home no matter what the setting. You can sit next to anybody. However, you, too, shouldn't have anything to do with Moon Pies. ARMADILLO (Nov 23 +AC0- Dec 21) You have a tendency to develop a tough exterior, but you are actually quite gentle and kind inside. A good evening for you? Old friends, a fire, some roots, fruit, worms, and insects. You are a throwback. You're not concerned with today's fashions and trends. You're not concerned with anything about today. You're almost prehistoric in your interests and behavior patterns. You probably want to marry another Armadillo, but a Possum is another somewhat kinky mating possibility.+ACI-
+ACI-A group of friends who went deer hunting separated into pairs for the day.

+ACI-A blonde had just totalled her car in a horrific road accident but miraculously, she managed to pry herself from the wreckage without a scratch and was applying fresh lipstick when a policeman arrived. +ACIAIg-My God+ACEAIgAi- the policeman gasped. +ACIAIg-Your car looks like an accordion that was jumped on by an elephant. Are you OK Miss?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Yes, Officer, I'm just fine+ACIAIg- the blonde chirped. +ACIAIg-Well, how in the world did this happen?+ACIAIg- the officer asked as he surveyed the wrecked car. +ACIAIg-Officer, it was the strangest thing+ACEAIgAi- the blonde began. +ACIAIg-I was driving along this road when from out of nowhere this tree pops up in front of me. So I swerved to the right, and there was another tree+ACE- I swerved to the left and there was ANOTHER tree+ACE- I swerved to the right and there was another tree+ACE- I swerved to the left and there was ....+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Uh, ma'am+ACIAIg-, the officer said, cutting her off, +ACIAIg-There isn't a tree on this road for 30 miles.

I knew a guy who was an avid hunter. He never missed a season. But one day, he went out in a bit of a hurry, and he accidentally grabbed his umbrella instead of his gun.+ACIAIg- The doctor continued, +ACIAIg-So he was in the woods, and suddenly a grizzly bear appeared in front of him+ACE- He raised up his umbrella, pointed it at the bear and squeezed the handle.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-And do you know what happened?+ACIAIg- the doctor queried. Dumbfounded, the old man replied, +ACIAIg-No.+ACIAIg- The doctor continued, +ACIAIg-The bear dropped dead in front of him+ACEAIgAi- +ACIAIg-That's impossible+ACEAIgAi- exclaimed the old man. +ACIAIg-Someone else must have shot that bear.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-That's kind of what I'm getting at,+ACIAIg- replied the doctor.+ACI-

+ACI-A guy calls a company and orders their 5+AC0-day, 10 lb. weight loss program. The next day, there's a knock on the door and there stands before him a voluptuous, athletic, 19 year old babe dressed in nothing but a pair of Nike running shoes and a sign round her neck. She introduces herself as a representative of the weight loss company. The sign reads, +ACIAIg-If you can catch me, you can have me.+ACIAIg- Without a second thought, he takes off after her. A few miles later, huffing and puffing, he finally catches her and has his way with her. The same girl shows up for the next four days and the same thing happens. On the fifth day, he weighs himself and is delighted to find he has lost 10 lb. as promised. He then calls the company and orders their 5+AC0-day, 20 lb. program.

+ACI-Dilbert's Salary Theorem states that Engineers and scientists can never earn as much as business executives and sales people. This theorem can now be supported by a mathematical equation based on the following two postulates: Postulate 1: Knowledge is Power. Postulate 2: Time is Money. As every engineer knows: Power +AD0- Work / Time Since: Knowledge +AD0- Power, then Knowledge +AD0- Work/Time, and Time +AD0- Money, then Knowledge +AD0- Work/Money. Solving for Money, we get: Money +AD0- Work / Knowledge. Thus, as Knowledge approaches zero, money approaches infinity, regardless of the amount of work done. Conclusion: The less you know, the more you make. Bummer.+ACI-

+ACI-This little old lady goes to the doctor and says, +ACIAIg-Doctor I have this problem with passing gas, but it really doesn't bother me too much. It never smells and it's always silent. As a matter of fact I've passed gas at least 20 times since I've been here in your office. You didn't know I was passing gas because it doesn't smell and it's silent+ACIAIg-. The doctor says +ACIAIg-I see.

+ACI-Two men went bear hunting. While one stayed in the cabin, the other went out looking for a bear. He soon found a huge bear, shot at it but only wounded it. The enraged bear charged toward him, he dropped his rifle and started running for the cabin as fast as he could. He ran pretty fast but the bear was just a little faster and gained on him with every step. Just as he reached the open cabin door, he tripped and fell flat. Too close behind to stop, the bear tripped over him and went rolling into the cabin. The man jumped up, closed the cabin door and yelled to his friend inside, +ACIAIg-You skin this one while I go and get another one+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-
+ACI-I was riding to work yesterday when I observed a female driver cut right in front of a pickup truck causing him to have to drive on to the shoulder. This evidently +ACoAKgAqACo-ed the driver off enough that he hung his head out his window and flipped the woman off. +ACIAIg-Man, that guy is stupid+ACIAIg- I thought to myself. I ALWAYS smile nicely and wave in a sheepish manner whenever a female does anything to me in traffic and here's why: I drive 38 miles each way every day to work, that's 76 miles. Of these, 16 miles each way is bumper+AC0-to+AC0-bumper. Most of the bumper+AC0-to+AC0-bumper is on an 8+AC0-lane highway so if you just look at the 7 lanes I am not in, that means I pass something like a new car every 40 feet per lane. That's 7 cars every 40 feet for 32 miles. That works out to be 982 cars every mile, or 31,424 cars. Even though the rest of the 34 miles is not bumper to bumper. I figure I pass at least another 4000 cars. That brings the number to something like 36,000 cars I pass every day. Statistically half of these are driven by females, that's 18,000. In any given group of females 1 in 28 are having the worst day of their period. That's 642. According to Cosmopolitan, 70+ACU- describe their love life as dissatisfying or unrewarding, that's 449. According to the National Institutes of Health, 22+ACU- of all females have seriously considered suicide or homicide, that's 98. And 34+ACU- describe men as their biggest problem, that's 33. According to the National Rifle Association 5+ACU- of all females carry weapons and this number is increasing. That means that EVERY SINGLE DAY, I drive past at least one female that has a lousy love life, thinks men are her biggest problem, has seriously considered suicide or homicide, is having the worst day of her period, and is armed. No matter what she does in traffic, I wouldn't DREAM of flipping her off.+ACI-

When he bent down under the table to pick them up, he noticed Bob's wife, Sue wasn't wearing any underwear under her dress+ACE- Shocked by this, Jim upon trying to sit back up again, hit his head on the table and emerged red+AC0-faced.

Surprised by her boldness, Jim admitted that, well indeed he did. She said, 'Well, you can have it but it will cost you +ACQ-500.' After taking a minute or two to assess the financial and moral costs of this offer, Jim confirms that he is interested. Sue told him that since her husband Bob worked Friday afternoons and Jim didn't, Jim should be at her house around 2 p.m. Friday afternoon. When Friday rolled around, Jim showed up at Bob's house at 2 p.m. sharp +AC0- and after paying Sue the agreed sum of +ACQ-500 +AC0- they went to the bedroom and closed their transaction, as agreed. Jim quickly dressed and left. As usual, Bob came home from work at 6 p.m. And upon arriving, asked his wife: 'Did Jim come by the house this afternoon?' With a lump in her throat Sue answered 'Why yes, he did stop by for a few minutes this afternoon 'Her heart nearly skipped a beat when her husband curtly asked, 'And did he give you +ACQ-500?' Sue, using her best poker face, replied, 'Well, yes, in fact he did give me +ACQ-500.' Bob, with a satisfied look on his face, surprised his wife by saying, 'He came by the office this morning and borrowed +ACQ-500 from me. He promised he'd stop by our house this afternoon on his way home and pay me back.' Now THAT, my friends, is a poker player+ACE-+ACI-

+ACI-Boudreaux went into the fish market to apply for a job. The boss thought to himself +AC0- I'm not hiring that lazy Cajun, so he decided to set a test for Boudreaux hoping he wouldn't be able to answer the questions and he'd be able to refuse him the job without getting into an argument.

+ACI-One day, the teacher walks into her classroom and announces to the class that on each Friday, she will ask a question to the class and anyone who answers correctly doesn't have to go to school the following Monday.

+ACI-Teaching Math in 1950: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for +ACQ-100. His cost of production is 4/5 of the price. What is his profit? Teaching Math in 1960: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for +ACQ-100. His cost of production is 4/5 of the price, or +ACQ-80. What is his profit? Teaching Math in 1970: A logger exchanges a set +ACIAIg-L+ACIAIg- of lumber for a set +ACIAIg-M+ACIAIg- of money. The cardinality of set +ACIAIg-M+ACIAIg- is 100. Each element is worth one dollar. Make 100 dots representing the elements of the set +ACIAIg-M+ACIAIg-. The set +ACIAIg-C+ACIAIg-, the cost of production contains 20 fewer points than set +ACIAIg-M+ACIAIg-. Represent the set +ACIAIg-C+ACIAIg- as a subset of set +ACIAIg-M+ACIAIg- and answer the following question: What is the cardinality of the set +ACIAIg-P+ACIAIg- of profits? Teaching Math in 1980: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for +ACQ-100. His cost of production is +ACQ-80 and his profit is +ACQ-20. Your assignment: Underline the number 20. Teaching Math in 1990: By cutting down beautiful forest trees, the logger makes +ACQ-20. What do you think of this way of making a living? Topic for class participation after answering the question? How did the forest birds and squirrels feel as the logger cut down the trees? There are no wrong answers. Teaching Math in 2000: By laying off 402 of its loggers, a company improves its stock price from +ACQ-80 to +ACQ-100. How much capital gain per share does the CEO make by exercising his stock options at +ACQ-80. Assume capital gains are no longer taxed, because this encourages investment. Teaching Math in 2006: A company outsources all of its loggers. They save on benefits and when demand for their product is down the logging work force can easily be cut back. The average logger employed by the company earned +ACQ-50,000, had 3 weeks vacation, received a nice retirement plan and medical insurance. The contracted logger charges +ACQ-50 an hour. Was outsourcing a good move? Teaching Math in 2007: A logging company exports its wood+AC0-finishing jobs to its Indonesian subsidiary and lays off the corresponding half of its US workers (the higher+AC0-paid half). It clear+AC0-cuts 95+ACU- of the forest, leaving the rest for the spotted owl, and lays off all its remaining US workers. It tells the workers that the spotted owl is responsible for the absence of fellable trees and lobbies Congress for exemption from the Endangered Species Act. Congress instead exempts the company from all federal regulation. What is the return on investment of the lobbying costs?+ACI-

+ACI-WASHINGTON, DC (AP) +AC0- Congress approved sweeping legislation, which provides new benefits for many Americans. The Americans With No Abilities Act (AWNAA), signed into law by President John Kerry shortly after its passage, is being hailed as a major victory by advocates of the millions of Americans who lack any real skills or ambition. +ACIAIg-Roughly 50 percent of Americans do not possess the competence and drive necessary to carve out a meaningful role for themselves in society,+ACIAIg- said Kerry, a longtime AWNAA supporter. +ACIAIg-This is why many of them voted for me. We can no longer stand by and allow People of Inability to be ridiculed and passed over. With this legislation, employers will no longer be able to grant special favors to a small group of workers, simply because they do a better job, or have some idea of what they are doing+ACIAIg-, said Kerry. President Kerry pointed to the success of the US Postal Service, which has a long+AC0-standing policy of providing opportunity without regard to performance. Approximately 80 percent of postal employees lack job skills, making this agency the single largest US employer of Persons of Inability. Private sector industries with good records of nondiscrimination against the Inept include retail sales (72+ACU-), the airline industry (68+ACU-),and home improvement +ACIAIg-warehouse+ACIAIg- stores (65+ACU-) President Kerry has also set an example, personally selecting hundreds of Nonabled people for top government positions, including many cabinet+AC0-level jobs. Under the Americans With No Abilities Act, more than 25 million +ACIAIg-middle man+ACIAIg- positions will be created, with important+AC0-sounding titles but little real responsibility, thus providing an illusory sense of purpose and performance. Mandatory non+AC0-performance+AC0-based raises and promotions will be given, to guarantee upward mobility for even the most unremarkable employees. The legislation provides substantial tax breaks to corporations which maintain a significant level of Persons of Inability in top positions, and gives a tax credit to small and medium businesses that agree to hire one clueless worker for every two talented hires. Finally, the AWNAA contains tough new measures to make it more difficult to discriminate against the Nonabled, banning discriminatory interview questions such as +ACIAIg-Do you have any goals for the future?+ACIAIg- or +ACIAIg-Do you have any skills or experience which relate to this job?+ACIAIg- and +ACIAIg-Are you awake?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-As a Nonabled person, I can't be expected to keep up with people who have something going for them,+ACIAIg- said Mary Lou Gertz, who lost her position as a lug+AC0-nut twister at the GM plant in Flint, MI due to her lack of notable job skills. +ACIAIg-This new law should really help people like me.+ACIAIg- With the passage of this bill, Gertz and millions of other untalented citizens can finally see a light at the end of the tunnel. Said Kerry, +ACIAIg-It is our duty as lawmakers to provide each and every American citizen, regardless of his or her adequacy, with some sort of space to take up in this great nation.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

Then, when they were only partway through the job, they determined that they did not, after all, have enough paint to complete the job. Not wishing to spend any more money if they didn't absolutely have to, they decided they would just dilute the water+AC0-based paint they were using so that it would last longer. They did this a couple more times before they finished, which caused striping on the church as the paint got lighter each time it was thinned. The painters had just about gotten to the top of the steeple, when, all of a sudden, the sky darkened, and the rain started to pour down. As the paint streamed down the sides of the church, a voice boomed from the heavens: +ACIAIg-Repaint, you thinners+ACE- Repaint, and thin no more+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

One day, about 9 months later, he came home to his confused wife. +ACIAIg-Honey,+ACIAIg- she said, +ACIAIg-you received a very strange post card today.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Oh, just give it to me and I'll explain it later,+ACIAIg- he said.

+ACI-A Hawaii woodpecker and a California woodpecker were arguing about which place had the toughest trees. The Hawaii woodpecker said Hawaii had a tree that no woodpecker could peck. The California woodpecker accepted his challenge, and promptly pecked a hole in the tree with no problem. The Hawaiian woodpecker was in awe. The California woodpecker then challenged the Hawaiian woodpecker to peck a tree in California that was absolutely unpeckable. The Hawaiian woodpecker expressed confidence he could do it, so accepted the challenge. After flying to California, the Hawaii woodpecker successfully pecked the tree with no problem. So the two woodpeckers were now confused. How is it that the Californian woodpecker was able to peck the Hawaiian tree and the Hawaiian woodpecker was able to peck the Californian tree, but neither one was able to peck the tree in their own state? After much woodpecker+AC0-pondering, they both came to the same conclusion +AC0- your pecker is always harder when you're away from home.+ACI-

+ACI-A lawyer and a blonde are sitting next to each other on a long flight from LA to NY. The lawyer leans over to her and asks if she would like to play a fun game. The blonde just wants to take a nap, so she politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. The lawyer persists and explains that the game is really easy and a lot of fun. He explains +ACIAIg-I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me +ACQ-5, and visa+AC0-versa.+ACIAIg- Again, she politely declines and tries to get some sleep. The lawyer, now some what agitated, says, +ACIAIg-Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me +ACQ-5, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you +ACQ-50+ACEAIgAi- figuring that since she is a blonde that he will easily win the match. This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring that there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game. The lawyer asks the first question. +ACIAIg-What's the distance from the earth to the moon?+ACIAIg- The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches in to her purse, pulls out a +ACQ-5 bill and hands it to the lawyer. Now, it's the blonde's turn. She asks the lawyer: +ACIAIg-What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?+ACIAIg- The lawyer looks at her with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references. He taps into the Airphone with his modem and searches the Net and the Library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends e+AC0-mails to all his coworkers and friends. All to no avail. After over an hour, he wakes the blonde and hands her +ACQ-50.

+ACI-The rules at a particular university were such that if the professor were not present in the classroom by 15 minutes past the hour, the class was considered a +ACIAIg-walk+ACIAIg- and the students were free to leave +AC0ALQ- with no penalties for missing a class. The rooms were equipped with the type wall clocks which +ACIAIg-jumped+ACIAIg- ahead each minute, in a very noticeable fashion. As it were, these clocks were also not of the most sophisticated construction. Some enterprising student discovered that if one were to hit the clock with chalkboard erasers, it would cause the clock to +ACIAIg-jump+ACIAIg- ahead 1 minute. So, it became almost daily practice for these students to take target practice at the clock (as it would have it, this particular professor was not the most punctual, and the students considered him severely +ACIAIg-absent+AC0-minded+ACIAIg-). A few well aimed erasers, and lo, 15 minutes were passed, and class dismissed itself. Well, when the day for the next exam rolled around, the professor strolled into the room, passed out the exams, and told them +ACIAIg-You have 1 hour to complete.+ACIAIg- The professor then proceeded to collect the erasers from around the room, gleefully took aim at the clock. When he had successfully +ACIAIg-jumped+ACIAIg- the clock forward 1 hour, he closed the class and collected the exam papers. Life does teach some lessons the hard way.+ACI-

+ACI-Finally, a way to know what to pitch and what to save+ACE- THE GAG TEST Anything that makes you gag is spoiled (except for leftovers from what you cooked for yourself last night). EGGS When something starts pecking its way out of the shell, the egg is probably past its prime. DAIRY PRODUCTS Milk is spoiled when it starts to look like yogurt. Yogurt is spoiled when it starts to look like cottage cheese. Cottage cheese is spoiled when it starts to look like regular cheese. Regular cheese is nothing but spoiled milk anyway and can't get any more spoiled than it is already. Cheddar cheese is spoiled when you think it is blue cheese but you realize you've never purchased that kind. MAYONNAISE If it makes you violently ill after you eat it, the mayonnaise is spoiled. FROZEN FOODS Frozen foods that have become an integral part of the defrosting problem in your freezer compartment will probably be spoiled +AC0- (or wrecked anyway) by the time you pry them out with a kitchen knife. EXPIRATION DATES This is NOT a marketing ploy to encourage you to throw away perfectly good food so that you'll spend more on groceries. Perhaps you'd benefit by having a calender in your kitchen. MEAT If opening the refrigerator door causes stray animals from a three+AC0-block radius to congregate outside your house, the meat is spoiled. BREAD Sesame seeds and Poppy seeds are the only officially acceptable +ACIAIg-spots+ACIAIg- that should be seen on the surface of any loaf of bread. Fuzzy and hairy looking white or green growth areas are a good indication that your bread has turned into a pharmaceutical laboratory experiment. FLOUR Flour is spoiled when it wiggles. SALT It never spoils. CEREAL It is generally a good rule of thumb that cereal should be discarded when it is two years or longer beyond the expiration date. LETTUCE Bibb lettuce is spoiled when you can't get it off the bottom of the vegetable crisper without Comet. Romaine lettuce is spoiled when it turns liquid. CANNED GOODS Any canned goods that have become the size or shape of a softball should be disposed of. Carefully. CARROTS A carrot that you can tie a clove hitch in is not fresh. RAISINS Raisins should not be harder than your teeth. POTATOES Fresh potatoes do not have roots, branches, or dense, leafy undergrowth. CHIP DIP If you can take it out of its container and bounce it on the floor, it has gone bad. EMPTY CONTAINERS Putting empty containers back into the refrigerator is an old trick, but it only works if you live with someone or have a maid. UNMARKED ITEMS You know it is well beyond prime when you're tempted to discard the Tupperware along with the food. Generally speaking, Tupperware containers should not burp when you open them. GENERAL RULE OF THUMB Most food cannot be kept longer than the average life span of a hamster. Keep a hamster in or nearby your refrigerator to gauge this.+ACI-

On the fourth floor, the sign is perfect: +ACIAIg-All the men here are tall and handsome.+ACIAIg- The women get all excited and are going in when they realize that there is still one floor left. Wondering what they are missing, they head on up to the fifth floor. There they find a sign that reads: +ACIAIg-There are no men here.

+ACI-There was a chicken farmer who lived in a village in China. One year,his chickens were afflicted with a strange blight that caused them to lose their feathers. The farmer was deeply concerned about this, because winter was coming, and, if the chickens had no feathers, they would freeze to death. So, the farmer decided to consult the two wisest men in the land. First,he visited Mr. Hing, the renowned scholar. Mr. Hing leafed through all his agricultural and medicinal texts and pored over books and scrolls well into the night. Finally, he returned to the farmer and told him that, if he crushed the leaves of a gum tree into powder, made it into tea, and fed it to his chickens, they would be cured.The farmer then went to Mr. Ming, the great seer. Mr. Ming cast stones, read tea leaves, and poked through entrails until finally he came up with the answer: +ACIAIg-As surely as gum causes a shoe to stick to the ground,tea made from gum leaves will cause feathers to stick to chickens. +ACIAIg-Now the farmer was ecstatic.

+ACI-She gets into the cab, and notices that the VERY handsome cab driver won't stop staring at her. She asks him why he is staring. He replies: +ACIAIg-I have a question to ask you but I don't want to offend you.+ACIAIg- She answers, +ACIAIg-My son, you cannot offend me. When you're as old as I am and have been a nun as long as I have, you get a chance to see and hear just about everything. I'm sure that there's nothing you could say or ask that I would find offensive.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Well, I've always had a fantasy to have a nun kiss me.+ACIAIg- She responds, +ACIAIg-Well, let's see what we can do about that: +ACM-1, you have to be single and +ACM-2, you must be Catholic.+ACIAIg- The cab driver is very excited and says, +ACIAIg-Yes, I'm single and Catholic+ACEAIgAi- +ACIAIg-OK+ACIAIg- the nun says. +ACIAIg-Pull in to the next alley.+ACIAIg- The nun fulfills his fantasy, with a kiss that would make a hooker blush. But when they get back on the road, the cab driver starts crying. +ACIAIg-My dear child,+ACIAIg- says the nun, +ACIAIg-why are you crying?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Forgive me but I've sinned. I lied and I must confess, I'm married and I'm Jewish.+ACIAIg- The nun says, +ACIAIg-That's OK. My name is Kevin and I'm going to a Halloween party.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-A contestant on +ACIAIg-Who Wants to be a Millionaire?+ACIAIg- had reached the final plateau. If she answered the next question correctly, she would win +ACQ-1,000,000. If she answered incorrectly, she would pocket only the 32,000 milestone money. And as she suspected it would be, the million+AC0-dollar question was no pushover. It was, +ACIAIg-Which of the following species of birds does not build its own nest, but instead lays its eggs in the nests of other birds? Is it A) the condor+ADs- B) the buzzard+ADs- C) the cuckoo+ADs- or D) the vulture?+ACIAIg- The woman was on the spot. She did not know the answer. And she was doubly on the spot because she had used up her 50/50 Lifeline and her Audience Poll Lifeline. All that remained was her Phone+AC0-a+AC0-Friend+ACE- Lifeline. The woman hoped she would not have to use it because ... her friend was, well .. blond. She had no alternative. She called her friend and gave her the question and the four choices. The blonde responded unhesitatingly: +ACIAIg-That's easy. The answer is C: The cuckoo.+ACIAIg- The contestant had to make a decision and make it fast. She considered employing a reverse strategy and giving Regis any answer except the one that her friend had given her. And considering that her friend was a blonde, that would seem to be the logical thing to do. On the other hand +AC0- the blonde had responded with such confidence, such certitude, that the contestant could not help but be persuaded. I need an answer,+ACIAIg- said Regis. Crossing her fingers, the contestant said, +ACIAIg-C: The cuckoo.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Is that your final answer?+ACIAIg- asked Regis. +ACIAIg-Yes, that is my final answer.+ACIAIg- Two minutes later, Regis said, +ACIAIg-That answer is ... absolutely correct+ACE- You are now a millionaire+ACEAIgAi- Three days later, the contestant hosted a party for her family and friends including the blonde who had helped her win the million dollars. +ACIAIg-Jenny, I just do not know how to thank you+ACE- ,+ACIAIg- said the contestant. +ACIAIg-How did you happen to know the right answer?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Oh, come on,+ACIAIg- said the blonde. +ACIAIg-Everybody knows that cuckoos don't build nests.

+ACI-TO: MR. JAMES THATCHER, BRAND MANAGER, PROCTER +ACY- GAMBLE. Dear Mr. Thatcher, I have been a loyal user of your Always maxi pads for over 20 years, and I appreciate many of their features. Why, without the LeakGuard Core(tm) or Dri+AC0-Weave(tm) absorbency, I'd probably never go horseback riding or salsa dancing, and I'd certainly steer clear of running up and down the beach in tight, white shorts. But my favorite feature has to be your revolutionary Flexi+AC0-Wings. Kudos on being the only company smart enough to realize how crucial it is that maxi pads be aerodynamic. I can't tell you how safe and secure I feel each month knowing there's a little F+AC0-16 in my pants. Have you ever had a menstrual period, Mr. Thatcher? Ever suffered from +ACIAIg-the curse+ACIAIg-? I'm guessing you haven't. Well, my +ACIAIg-time of the month+ACIAIg- is starting right now. As I type, I can already feel hormonal forces violently surging through my body. Just a few minutes from now, my body will adjust and I'll be transformed into what my husband likes to call +ACIAIg-an inbred hillbilly with knife skills.+ACIAIg- Isn't the human body amazing? As brand manager in the feminine+AC0-hygiene division, you've no doubt seen quite a bit of research on what exactly happens during your customers' monthly visits from Aunt Flo. Therefore, you must know about the bloating, puffiness, and cramping we endure, and about our intense mood swings, crying jags, and out+AC0-of+AC0-control behavior. You surely realize it's a tough time for most women. In fact, only last week, my friend Jennifer fought the violent urge to shove her boyfriend's testicles into a George Foreman Grill just because he told her he thought Grey's Anatomy was written by drunken chimps. Crazy+ACE- The point is, sir, you of all people must realize that America is just crawling with homicidal maniacs in capri pants. Which brings me to the reason for my letter. Last month, while in the throes of cramping so painful I wanted to reach inside my body and yank out my uterus, I opened an Always maxi pad, and there, printed on the adhesive backing, were these words: +ACIAIg-Have a Happy Period.+ACIAIg- Are you f+AEA-cking kidding me? What I mean is, does any part of your tiny middle+AC0-manager brain really think happiness+AC0-actual smiling, laughing happiness+AC0-is possible during a menstrual period? Did anything mentioned above sound the least bit pleasurable? Well, did it, James? FYI, unless you're some kind of sick S+ACY-M+ADs- freak girl, there will never be anything +ACIAIg-happy+ACIAIg- about a day in which you have to jack yourself up on Motrin and Kahlua and lock yourself in your house just so you don't march down to the local Walgreens armed with a hunting rifle and a sketchy plan to end your life in a blaze of glory. For the love of God, pull your head out, man. If you just have to slap a moronic message on a maxi pad, wouldn't it make more sense to say something that's actually pertinent, like +ACIAIg-Put Down the Hammer+ACIAIg- or +ACIAIg-Vehicular Manslaughter Is Wrong+ACIAIg-? Or are you just picking on us? Sir, please inform your accounting department that, effective immediately, there will be an +ACQ-8 drop in monthly profits, for I have chosen to take my maxi+AC0-pad business elsewhere. And though I will certainly miss your Flexi+AC0-Wings, I will not for one minute miss your brand of condescending bullsh+ACo-t. And that's a promise I will keep. Always. Best, Wendi Austin, TX+ACI-

+ACI-A man goes to the confessional. +ACIAIg-Forgive me father, for I have sinned.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-What is your sin, my child?+ACIAIg- The priest asks back. +ACIAIg-Well,+ACIAIg- the man starts, +ACIAIg-I used some horrible language this week and I feel absolutely terrible.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-When did you do use this awful language?+ACIAIg- said the priest. +ACIAIg-I was golfing and hit an incredible drive that looked like it was going to go over 250 yards, but it struck a phone line that was hanging over the fairway and fell straight down to the ground after going only about 100yards.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Is that when you swore?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No, Father.+ACIAIg- Said the man. +ACIAIg-After that, a squirrel ran out of the bushes and grabbed my ball in his mouth and began to run away.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Is THAT when you swore?+ACIAIg- asked the Father again. +ACIAIg-Well, no.+ACIAIg- said the man, +ACIAIg-You see, as the squirrel was running, an eagle came down out of the sky, grabbed the squirrel in his talons and began to fly away+ACEAIgAi- +ACIAIg-Is THAT when you swore?+ACIAIg- asked the amazed Priest. +ACIAIg-No, not yet.+ACIAIg- The man replied. +ACIAIg-As the eagle carried the squirrel away in his claws, it flew towards the green. And as it passed over a bit of forest near the green, the squirrel dropped my ball.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Did you swear THEN?+ACIAIg- asked the now impatient Priest. +ACIAIg-No, because as the ball fell it struck a tree, bounced through some bushes, careened off a big rock, and rolled through a sand trap onto the green and stopped within six inches of the hole.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-You missed the f+ACo-cking putt, didn't you?+ACIAIg- sighed the Priest.+ACI-

+ACI-It is a little+AC0-known fact that before becoming president of South Korea, Syngman Rhee was for many years foreign corresponcent for Life magazine, dividing his time between their New York and Seoul offices. One day, he left New York for a routine trip to Seoul, but, when he wasn't heard from, the New York office became worried and called the Seoul office. The Seoul office confirmed that he had arrived as scheduled but had left almost immediately for North Korea. They quoted him as saying that he was not at liberty to say where he could be reached but that he would be doing a story on how the other half lived, promising to cable it to Seoul and New York on completion.The New York office was worried and decided to send a bilingual correspondent to North Korea to try to locate him. He arrived in Seoul, at which time he was told that they had had an update: Syngman Rhee had called in a half hour earlier to say that his story would concern interviews with a taxi driver, a tailor, and a restaurant manager, all in Pyongyang. But he still declined to supply a contact address.So the reporter decided to go to Pyongyang to track him down. At the Pyongyang airport he took a taxi into town, and luck was with him: while his taxi driver had not been the one interviewed, he knew the driver who had, and he gave the reporter his name. When reporter talked to the driver, the driver said that Rhee had planned to interview a tailor in a district known for its many tailors.Again luck was with him: out of 3,518 tailors, he only had to talk to 17 before finding the one who had been interviewed by Rhee: he quoted him as saying he intended to talk to a restaurant manager located in a suburb of Pyongyang. Acting on a hunch that the suburb would be the last one on the commuter train line, he took the train for the northern suburbs and got off at the last stop. He interviewed a restaurant manager there without success, so he returned to Pyongyang Central Station and took a train to the northeast, getting off at the last stop. In this way he worked his way around, taking trains to the east, then southeast, and again luck was with him. He did not have to get half way around the circuit before arriving at the last town on a line running southeast of Pyongyang, where he talked to the manager of one of the town's only two restaurants. The manager confirmed that Syngman Rhee had gone to the other one for his interview.Arriving there, the correspondent talked to the manager, who said that Rhee had just interviewed him and was now in the kitchen talking to the staff. The reporter went into the kitchen, and there was Syngman Rhee, looking as if he hadn't aged a day in three months, sipping a cup of tea with the staff with his notebook on his knee. The correspondent said, +ACIAIg-Ah, sweet Mr. Rhee of Life, at last I've found you+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

Next day she needed to get chicken breasts, again she didn't know how to say it, and so she clucked like a chicken and unbuttoned her blouse to show the butcher her breasts.

+ACI-A tourist wanders into a back+AC0-alley antique shop in San Francisco's Chinatown. Picking through the objects on display he discovers a detailed, life+AC0-sized bronze sculpture of a rat. The sculpture is so interesting and unique that he picks it up and asks the shop owner what it costs. +ACIAIg-Twelve dollars for the rat, sir,+ACIAIg- says the shop owner, +ACIAIg-and a thousand dollars more for the story behind it.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-You can keep the story, old man,+ACIAIg- he replies, +ACIAIg-but I'll take the rat.+ACIAIg- The transaction complete, the tourist leaves the store with the bronze rat under his arm. As he crosses the street in front of the store, two live rats emerge from a sewer drain and fall into step behind him. Nervously looking over his shoulder, he begins to walk faster, but every time he passes another sewer drain, more rats come out and follow him. By the time he's walked two blocks, at least a hundred rats are at his heels, and people begin to point and shout. He walks even faster, and soon breaks into a trot as multitudes of rats swarm from sewers, basements, vacant lots, and abandoned cars. Rats by the thousands are at his heels, and as he sees the waterfront at the bottom of the hill, he panics and starts to run full tilt. No matter how fast he runs, the rats keep up, squealing hideously, now not just thousands but millions, so that by the time he comes rushing up to the water's edge a trail of rats twelve city blocks long is behind him. Making a mighty leap, he jumps up onto a light post, grasping it with one arm while he hurls the bronze rat into San Francisco Bay with the other, as far as he can heave it. Pulling his legs up and clinging to the light post, he watches in amazement as the seething tide of rats surges over the breakwater into the sea, where they drown. Shaken and mumbling, he makes his way back to the antique shop. +ACIAIg-Ah, so you've come back for the rest of the story,+ACIAIg- says the owner. +ACIAIg-No,+ACIAIg- says the tourist, +ACIAIg-I was wondering if you have a bronze lawyer.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-A young man wanted to purchase a gift for his new sweetie for Valentine's Day. As they had not been dating very long, it was a very difficult decision. After careful consideration he decided a good gift would be a pair of gloves. Accompanied by his sister, he went to the store and bought the gloves. His sister purchased a pair of panties at the same time. The clerk carefully wrapped both items but in the process got them mixed up. The sister was handed the gloves and the young man got the panties. The young man mailed his Valentine's Day gift with the following note: This special Valentines Day gift was chosen because I noticed you are in the habit of not wearing any when we go out in the evenings. If it had not been for my sister, I would have chosen the ones with buttons, but she prefers short ones that are much easier to remove. These are a lovely shade, the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they were hardly soiled. I had her try yours on for me and they looked quite lovely. I wish I was there to put them on you for the first time+ADs- no doubt, other hands will come into contact with them before I have a chance to see you again. When you take them off, remember to blow on them lightly before putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing. Just think how many times I'll be kissing them in the future. I hope you'll wear them Friday night for me. Love, Honey Bear P.S. The sales lady says the latest style is to wear them folded down with just a little fur showing.+ACI-

+ACI-The FAA has a device for testing the strength of windshields on airplanes. They point this thing at the windshield of the aircraft and shoot a dead chicken at about the speed the air+AC0- craft normally flies at it. If the windshield doesn't break, it's likely to survive a real collision with a bird during flight. The British had recently built a new locomotive that could pull a train faster than any before it. They were not sure that its windshield was strong enough so they borrowed the testing device from the FAA, reset it to approximate the maximum speed of the locomotive, loaded in the dead chicken, and fired. The bird went through the windshield, broke the engineer's chair, and made a major dent in the back wall of the engine cab. They were quite surprised with this result, so they asked the FAA to check the test to see if everything was done correctly. The FAA checked everything and suggested that they might want to repeat the test using a thawed chicken.+ACI-

You are the only white man that has ever set foot in our village. It doesn't take a genius to figure out what has been going on+ACEAIgAi- The missionary replies: +ACIAIg-No, no, my good man. You are mistaken. What you have here is a natural occurrence +AC0- what is called an albino. Look over there to your fields. You see a field of white sheep, and yet amongst them is one black one. Nature does this on occasion.+ACIAIg- The chief pauses for a moment then says, +ACIAIg-Tell you what, you don't say anything about the black sheep, and I won't say anything about the white child.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-Once there was a little boy that lived in the country. They had to use an outhouse, and the little boy hated it because it was hot in the summer and cold in the winter and stank all the time. The outhouse was sitting on the bank of a creek and the boy determined that one day he would push that outhouse into the creek. One day after a spring rain, the creek was swollen so the little boy decided today was the day to push the outhouse into the creek. So he got a large stick and started pushing. Finally, the outhouse toppled into the creek and floated away. That night his dad told him they were going to the woodshed after supper. Knowing that meant a spanking, the little boy asked why. The dad replied, +ACIAIg-Someone pushed the outhouse into the creek today. It was you, wasn't it son?+ACIAIg- The boy answered yes. Then he thought a moment and said, +ACIAIg-Dad, I read in school today that George Washington chopped down a cherry tree and didn't get into trouble because he told the truth.+ACIAIg- The dad replied, +ACIAIg-Well, son, George Washington's father wasn't in the cherry tree.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-I was riding to work yesterday when I observed a female driver cut right in front of a pickup truck, causing him to have to drive on to the shoulder to avoid hitting her. This evidently angered the driver enough that he hung his arm out his window and +ACIAIg-flipped+ACIAIg- the woman off. Man, that guy is stupid, I thought to myself. I ALWAYS smile nicely and wave in a sheepish manner whenever a female does anything to me in traffic, and I drive 48 miles each way every day to work. That's 96 miles each day. Of these, 16 miles each way is bumper+AC0-to+AC0-bumper. Most of the bumper+AC0-to+AC0-bumper is on an 8+AC0-lane highway. There are 7 cars every 40 feet for 32 miles. That works out to be 982 cars every mile, or 31,424 cars. Even though the rest of the 32 miles is not bumper+AC0-to+AC0-bumper, I figure I pass at least another 4000 cars. That brings the number to something like 36,000 cars that I pass every day. Statistically, females drive half of these. That's 18,000 women drivers+ACE- In any given group of females, 1 in 28 has PMS. That's 642. According to Cosmopolitan, 70+ACU- describe their love life as dissatisfying or unrewarding. That's 449. According to the National Institute of Health, 22+ACU- of all females have seriously considered suicide or homicide. That's 98. And 34+ACU- describe men as their biggest problem. That's 33. According to the National Rifle Association, 5+ACU- of all females carry weapons, and this number is increasing. That means that EVERY SINGLE DAY, I drive past at least one female that has a lousy love life, thinks men are her biggest problem, has seriously considered suicide or homicide, has PMS, and is armed. Flip one off? I think not.+ACI-

Watch while I prove it to you.+ACIAIg- The barber puts a dollar bill in one hand and two quarters in the other, then calls the boy over and asks, +ACIAIg-Which do you want, son?+ACIAIg- The boy takes the quarters and leaves. +ACIAIg-What did I tell you?+ACIAIg- said the barber. +ACIAIg-That kid never learns+ACEAIgAi- Later, when the customer leaves, he sees the same young boy coming out of the ice cream store. +ACIAIg-Hey, son+ACE- May I ask you a question?

The older doctor marched down the hallway to the back where the first doctor was and demanded, +ACIAIg-What's the matter with you? Mrs. Terry is 63 years old, she has four grown children and seven grandchildren, and you told her she was pregnant?+ACIAIg- The new doctor continued to write on his clipboard and, without looking up, said, +ACIAIg-Does she still have the hiccups?+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-A factory worker at a factory that made hammers, screwdrivers and other small tools, was seen taking the trash through the front door in a wheelbarrow. The security guard stopped him and informed the employee that he would have to examine the trash to be sure there were nothing being smuggled out of the factory. The employee didn't object and the guard proceeded to searched the trash. He did not find anything unusual and let the employee continue. The next day, the employee again took the trash out with a wheelbarrow. As expected, the guard insisted upon searching the trash, but still found nothing unusual. This continued for a month and the security guard was becoming extremely suspicious. One day, he decided he would confront the employee. When the employee brought out the trash, the guard said, +ACIAIg-I know you are taking something from here but I just can't find it. You had better confess now or else+ACEAIgAi- The employee decided there was no way out and he said, +ACIAIg-You know all the times I have taken out the trash and you searched it and found nothing?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Yes...+ACIAIg- replied the guard, eager for an answer. The employee continued, +ACIAIg-Well so far I have taken 30 wheelbarrows.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-Jimmie, an 80+AC0-year+AC0-old gentleman, retired to Florida after his wife of 58 years had passed away. He was quite alone in the world and longed for companionship. One day, as he was walking through a public park, he spied what he considered to be a very pretty silver+AC0-haired lady sitting alone on a park bench. Getting his nerve up, he approached the lady and asked graciously, +ACIAIg-Pardon me, ma'am, but may I sit here with you.+ACIAIg- The silver+AC0-haired Marcia looked up to see a distinguished looking white+AC0-haired gentleman and replied, +ACIAIg-Why certainly,+ACIAIg- and scooted over gently to give him room to sit down. For the next two hours the two sat and talked about everything. They discovered that they came from the same part of the country, liked the same big band music, voted for the same presidential candidates, had had long happy marriages and lost their spouses in the last year, and in general agreed about almost everything. Finally, the old gentleman cleared his throat and asked sheepishly, +ACIAIg-Ma'am, may I ask you two questions?+ACIAIg- With great anticipation Marcia replied, +ACIAIg-Why certainly+ACEAIgAi- The old gentleman removed a handkerchief from his coat pocket and spread it out on the ground before her.

+ACI-This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years. The only friction in their marriage was thehusband's habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke. The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air. Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor+ADs- she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. The years went by and he continued to rip them out+ACE- Then one Christmas morning as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the bowl where she had put the turkey innards and neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts.

Sometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting, which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bathroom. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing , tears in her eyes+ACE- After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his bloodstained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter.

All these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-What do you mean?+ACIAIg- asked his wife. +ACIAIg-Well you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened. But by the grace of God, some Vaseline, and these two fingers, I think I got most of them back in.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-Two Indians and an Irishman were walking through the woods. All of a sudden one of the Indians ran up a hill to the mouth of a small cave. +ACIAIg-Wooooo+ACE- Wooooo+ACE- Wooooo+ACEAIgAi- he called into the cave and listened closely until he heard an answering, +ACIAIg-Wooooo+ACE- Wooooo+ACE- Woooooo+ACE- He then tore off his clothes and ran into the cave. The Irishman was puzzled and asked the remaining Indian what it was all about. +ACIAIg-Was the other Indian crazy or what?+ACIAIg- The Indian replied +ACIAIg-No, It is our custom during mating season when Indian men see cave, they holler 'Wooooo+ACE- Wooooo+ACE- Wooooo+ACE-' into the opening.

He also tore off his clothes and ran into the opening. The Irishman wandered around in the woods alone for a while, and then spied a third large cave. As he looked in amazement at the size of the huge opening, he was thinking, +ACIAIg-Hoo, man+ACE- Look at the size of this cave+ACE- It is bigger than those the Indians found. There must be some really big, fine women in this cave+ACEAIgAi- He stood in front of the opening and hollered with all his might +ACIAIg-Wooooo+ACE- Wooooo+ACE- Wooooo+ACEAIgAi- Like the others, he then heard an answering call, +ACIAIg-WOOOOOOOOO,WOOOOOOOOO WOOOOOOOOO+ACEAIgAi- With a gleam in his eye and a smile on his face, he raced into the cave, tearing off his clothes as he ran.

You're not to see that woman again. For your penance, say five Hail Mary's and put +ACQ-50 in the poor box.+ACIAIg- The Irishman left the confessional, said his prayers, and then walked over to the poor box.

+ACI-An Amish boy and his father were in a mall. They were amazed by almost everything they saw, but especially by two shiny, silver walls that could move apart and then slide back together again. The boy asked, +ACIAIg-What is this, Father?+ACIAIg- The father (never having seen an elevator) responded, +ACIAIg-Son, I have never seen anything like this in my life, I don't know what it is.+ACIAIg- While the boy and his father were watching with amazement, a fat, ugly old lady moved up to the moving walls and pressed a button. The walls opened, and the lady walked between them into a small room. The walls closed, and the boy and his father watched the small numbers above the walls light up sequentially. They continued to watch until it reached the last number, and then the numbers began to light in the reverse order. Finally the walls opened up again and a gorgeous 24+AC0-year+AC0-old blond stepped out.

+ACI-WANTED FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER (the actual AP headline) Linda Burnett, 23, a resident of San Diego, was visiting her inlaws, and while there went to a nearby supermarket to pick up some groceries. Several people noticed her sitting in her car with the windows rolled up and with her eyes closed, with both hands behind the back of her head. One customer who had been at the store for a while became concerned and walked over to the car. He noticed that Linda's eyes were now open, and she looked very strange. He asked her if she was okay, and Linda replied that she'd been shot in the back of the head, and had been holding her brains in for over an hour. The man called the paramedics, who broke into the car because the doors were locked and Linda refused to remove her hands from her head. When they finally got in, they found that Linda had a wad of bread dough on the back of her head. A Pillsbury biscuit canister had exploded from the heat, making a loud noise that sounded like a gunshot, and the wad of dough hit her in the back of her head. When she reached back to find out what it was, she felt the dough and thought it was her brains. She initially passed out, but quickly recovered and tried to hold her brains in for over an hour until someone noticed and came to her aid. And, yes, Linda is a blonde.+ACI-

+ACI-A team of American and British archaeologists was excavating in Israel when they came upon a cave. Written on the wall of the cave were the following symbols in their order of appearance: 1. a woman 2. a donkey 3. a shovel 4. a fish 5. a Star of David They decided that this was a unique find and the writings were at least more than three thousand years old. They chopped out the piece of stone and had it brought to the museum where archeologists from all over the world came to study the ancient symbols. They held a huge meeting after months of conferences to discuss what they could agree was the meaning of the markings. The president of their society stood up and pointed at the first drawing and said: +ACIAIg-This looks like a woman. We can judge that this race was family oriented and held women in high esteem. You can also tell they were intelligent, as the next symbol resembles a donkey, so, they were smart enough to have animals help them till the soil. The next drawing looks like a shovel of some sort, which means they even had tools to help them. Even further proof of their high intelligence is the fish which means that if they had a famine hit the earth, whereby the food didn't grow, they would take to the sea for food. The last symbol sppears to be the Star of David which means they were evidently Hebrews.+ACIAIg- The audience applauded enthusiasticlly and the president smiled and said, +ACIAIg-I'm glad to see that you are all in full agreement with our interpretations.+ACIAIg- Suddenly a little old man stood up in the back of the room and said, +ACIAIg-I object to every word. The explanation of what the writings say is quite simple. First of all, while you've been 'reading' and 'interpreting' these inscriptions from left to right, everyone knows that the Hebrews would have written from right to left. +ACIAIg-Now, look again: It says, 'Holy mackerel, dig the ass on that woman+ACE-'+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-Description Missus manifests as a female humanoid providing cooking/cleaning features, and a sitting+AC0-room/TV it is a remote hijacker, targeted at unsuspecting male humanoids. There may be problems with pop+AC0-ups. Variants Girlfriend 1.0 was the first variant, targeted at mycash.com, later versions of Girlfriend exploit the same resources using more sophisticated methods. Live+AF8-in (any version) uses different profiles and is targeted at mywayoflife.com. Missus 2.7 is the current variant in which the cooking/cleaning/nookie features are much less effective but the resource consumption is two orders of magnitude greater Also known as SWMBO, 'er indoors, the totty, the little woman. Distribution The Girlfriend variants have sometimes been bundled with got+AC0-drunk, went clubbing and chatted+AF8-up+AF8-sister's+AF8-mate. The parasitic forms (Live+AC0-in and Missus) are invariably self+AC0-installing, exploiting any firewall deficiencies to immediately grab Administrator privileges and closing out any other Administrator access. What it does Missus is a blended threat and operates phased attack: 1. It progressively closes all access to any competing products. 2. It grabs access to all available resources 3. It uninstalls the +ACIAIg-toys and gadgets+ACIAIg- folder completely, and then reprogrammes the firewall to block any related addresses. 4. It installs +ACIAIg-soft furnishings.dll+ACIAIg- and +ACIAIg-redecorate.vxd+ACIAIg- (the virtual driver being recursed on a 12+AC0-month cycle). 5. It closes down un+AC0-wanted processes like pubnight, havefun, watchfootie etc. 6. Having achieved the above it spawns new sub+AC0-processes to consolidate its control. 7. It may install parasitic programmes and spyware like In+AC0-Laws 1.0 Privacy violation Only for the first few months +AC0- after that it prohibits any violation of its privacy. Security issues Yes, your security of title and tenure is severely threatened by the prospect of CPA.VXD. Stability problems Very unstable +AC0- prone to spontaneous breakdown without cause. Recovery only possible by allocating ever more resources and granting greater privileges. These steps are non+AC0-reversible.

Clerk: Our lowest price is +ACQ-12 a gallon, and we have 60 different prices up to +ACQ-200 a gallon. Customer: What's the difference in the paint? Clerk: Oh, there isn't any difference+ADs- it's all the same paint. Customer: Well, then I'd like some of that +ACQ-12 paint. Clerk: When do you intend to use the paint? Customer: I want to paint tomorrow. It's my day off. Clerk: Sir, the paint for tomorrow is the +ACQ-200 paint. Customer: When would I have to paint to get the +ACQ-12 paint? Clerk: You would have to start very late at night in about 3 weeks. But you will have to agree to start painting before Friday of that week and continue painting until at least Sunday. Customer: You've got to be +ACoAJgAlAF4AIwBAACo- kidding+ACE- Clerk: I'll check and see if we have any paint available. Customer: You have shelves FULL of paint+ACE- I can see it+ACE- Clerk: But it doesn't mean that we have paint available. We sell only a certain number of gallons on any given weekend. Oh, and by the way, the price per gallon just went to +ACQ-16. We don't have any more +ACQ-12 paint. Customer: The price went up as we were talking? Clerk: Yes, sir. We change the prices and rules hundreds of times a day, and since you haven't actually walked out of the store with your paint yet, we just decided to change. I suggest you purchase your paint as soon as possible. How many gallons do you want? Customer: Well, maybe five gallons. Make that six, so I'll have enough. Clerk: Oh no, sir, you can't do that. If you buy paint and don't use it, there are penalties and possible confiscation of the paint you already have. Customer: WHAT? Clerk: We can sell enough paint to do your kitchen, bathroom, hall and north bedroom, but if you stop painting before you do the bedroom, you will lose your remaining gallons of paint. Customer: What does it matter whether I use all the paint? I already paid you for it+ACE- Clerk: We make plans based upon the idea that all our paint is used, every drop. If you don't, it causes us all sorts of problems. Customer: This is crazy+ACEAIQ- I suppose something terrible happens if I don't keep painting until after Saturday night+ACE- Clerk: Oh yes+ACE- Every gallon you bought automatically becomes the +ACQ-200 paint. Customer: But what are all these, +ACIAIg-Paint on sale from +ACQ-10 a liter+ACIAIg- signs? Clerk: Well that's for our budget paint. It only comes in half+AC0-gallons. One +ACQ-5 half+AC0-gallon will do half a room. The second half+AC0-gallon to complete the room is +ACQ-20. None of the cans have labels, some are empty and there are no refunds, even on the empty cans. Customer: To hell with this+ACE- I'll buy what I need somewhere else+ACE- Clerk: I don't think so, sir. You may be able to buy paint for your bathroom and bedrooms, and your kitchen and dining room from someone else, but you won't be able to paint your connecting hall and stairway from anyone but us. And I should point out, sir, that if you paint in only one direction, it will be +ACQ-300 a gallon. Customer: I thought your most expensive paint was +ACQ-200+ACE- Clerk: That's if you paint around the room to the point at which you started. A hallway is different. Customer: And if I buy +ACQ-200 paint for the hall, but only paint in one direction, you'll confiscate the remaining paint. Clerk: No, we'll charge you an extra use fee plus the difference on your next gallon of paint. But I believe you're getting it now, sir.

The little boy watched in amazement and then asked, +ACIAIg-What's the matter haven't you ever seen a little boy before?+ACIAIg- ELDERLY While working for an organization that delivers lunches to elderly shut+AC0-ins, I used to take my 4+AC0-year+AC0-old daughter on my afternoon rounds. The various appliances of old age, particularly the canes, walkers and wheelchairs, unfailingly intrigued her. One day I found her staring at a pair of false teeth soaking in a glass.

+ACI-Some of us Southerners are pretty skeptical of horoscopes and the people that read them. If we are to ever fully understand all the star signs and the people they represent, we need symbols that all true Southerners understand: See the list below... OKRA (Dec 22 +AC0- Jan 20) Are tough on the outside but tender on the inside. Okras have tremendous influence. An older Okra can look back over his life and see the seeds of his influence everywhere. You can do something good each day if you try. CHITLIN (Jan 21 +AC0- Feb 19) Chitlins come from humble backgrounds. A Chitlin, however, will make something of himself if he is motivated and has lots of seasoning. In dealing with Chitlins, be careful they may surprise you. They can erupt like Vesuvius. Chitlins are best with Catfish and Okra. BOLL WEEVIL (Feb 20 +AC0- March 20) You have an overwhelming curiosity. You're unsatisfied with the surface of things, and you feel the need to bore deep into the interior of everything. Needless to say, you are very intense and driven as if you had some inner hunger. You love to stay busy and tend to work too much. Nobody in their right mind is going to marry you, so don't worry about it. MOON PIE (March 21 +AC0- April 20) You're the type that spends a lot of time on the front porch. A cinch to recognize the physical appearance of Moon Pies. Big and round are the key words here. You should marry anybody who you can get remotely interested in the idea. It's not going to be easy. You always have a big smile and are happy. This might be the year to think about aerobics. Maybe not. POSSUM (April 21 +AC0- May 21) When confronted with life's difficulties, possums have a marked tendency to withdraw and develop a don't+AC0-bother+AC0-me+AC0-about+AC0-it attitude. Sometimes you become so withdrawn, people actually think you're dead. This strategy is probably not psychologically healthy but seems to work for you. You are a rare breed. Most folks love to watch you work and play. You are a night person and mind your own business. CRAWFISH (May 22 +AC0- June 21) Crawfish is a water sign. If you work in an office, you're hanging around the water cooler. Crawfish prefer the beach to the mountains, the pool to the golf course, and the bathtub to the living room. You tend not to be particularly attractive physically, but you have very, very good heads. COLLARDS (June 22 +AC0- July 23) Collards have a genius for communication. They love to get in the melting pot of life and share their essence with the essence of those around them. Collards make good social workers, psychologists, and baseball managers. As far as your personal life goes, if you are Collards, stay away from Crawfish. It just won't work. Save yourself a lot of heartache. CATFISH (July 24 +AC0- Aug 23) Catfish are traditionalists in matters of the heart, although one's whiskers may cause problems for loved ones. You Catfish are never easy people to understand. You run fast. You work and play hard. Even though you prefer the muddy bottoms to the clear surface of life, you are liked by most. Above all else, Catfish should stay away from Moon Pies. GRITS (Aug 24 +AC0- Sept 23) Your highest aim is to be with others like yourself. You like to huddle together with a big crowd of other Grits. You love to travel though, so maybe you should think about joining a club. Where do you like to go? Anywhere they have cheese, gravy, bacon, butter, or eggs and a good time. If you can go somewhere where they have all these things, that serves you well. You are pure in heart. BOILED PEANUTS (Sept 24 +AC0- Oct 23) You have a passionate desire to help your fellow man. Unfortunately, those who know you best, your friends and loved ones, may find that your personality is much too salty, and their criticism will affect you deeply because you are really much softer than you appear. You should go right ahead and marry anybody you want to because in a certain way, yours is a charmed life. On the road of life, you can be sure that people will always pull over and stop for you. BUTTER BEAN (Oct 24 +AC0- Nov 22) Always invite a Butter Bean to a party because Butter Beans get along well with everybody. You, as a Butter Bean, should be proud. You've grown on the vine of life, and you feel at home no matter what the setting. You can sit next to anybody. However, you, too, shouldn't have anything to do with Moon Pies. ARMADILLO (Nov 23 +AC0- Dec 21) You have a tendency to develop a tough exterior, but you are actually quite gentle and kind inside. A good evening for you? Old friends, a fire, some roots, fruit, worms, and insects. You are a throwback. You're not concerned with today's fashions and trends. You're not concerned with anything about today. You're almost prehistoric in your interests and behavior patterns. You probably want to marry another Armadillo, but a Possum is another somewhat kinky mating possibility.+ACI-

The husband wakes from his drunken stupor and stumbles into the bathroom. As he stands in front of the toilet, he glances in the mirror and sees a blue ribbon attached to his privates. He is very confused and as he walks back into the bedroom he sees the red ribbon attached to his dog's testicles. He shakes his head and looks at the dog and whispers, +ACIAIg-I don't know where we were, or, what we did, but, by God, we took first and second place.+ACI-

The surgeon was there waiting for the service manager to come take a look at his bike when the mechanic shouted across the garage. +ACIAIg-Hey Doc, can I ask you a question?+ACIAIg- The surgeon, a bit surprised, walked over to where the mechanic was working on the motorcycle. The mechanic straightened up, wiped his hands on a rag and asked, +ACIAIg-So Doc, look at this engine. I open its heart, take the valves out, repair any damage, and then put them back in, and when I finish, it works just like new. So, how come I get such a small salary and you get the really big bucks, when you and I are doing basically the same work?+ACIAIg- The surgeon paused, smiled and leaned over, and whispered to the mechanic....+ACIAIg-Try doing it with the engine running..+ACIAIg-+ACI-

You've graduated from the best schools+ADs- your recommendations are wonderful, and your experience is unparalleled. Normally, we'd hire you without a second thought.

+ACI-A minister concluded that his church was getting into serious financial troubles. While checking the church storeroom, he discovered several cartons of new bibles that had never been opened and distributed. So at his Sunday sermon, he asked for three volunteers from the congregation who would be willing to sell the bibles door+AC0-to+AC0-door for +ACQ-10 each to raise the desperately needed money for the church. Peter, Paul and Louie all raised their hands to volunteer for the task. The minister knew that Peter and Paul earned their living as salesmen and were likely capable of selling some bibles. But he had serious doubts about Louie who was a local farmer, who had always kept to himself because he was embarrassed by his speech impediment. Poor Louis stuttered badly. But, not wanting to discourage Louis, the minister decided to let him try anyway. He sent the three of them away with the back seat of their cars stacked with bibles. He asked them to meet with him and report the results of their door+AC0-to+AC0-door selling efforts the following Sunday. Anxious to find out how successful they were, the minister immediately asked Peter, +ACIAIg-Well, Peter, how did you make out selling our bibles last week?+ACIAIg- Proudly handing the reverend an envelope, Peter replied, +ACIAIg-Using my sales prowess, I was able to sell 20 bibles, and here's the +ACQ-200 I collected on behalf of the church.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Fine job, Peter+ACEAIgAi- The minister said, vigorously shaking his hand. +ACIAIg-You are indeed a fine salesman and the Church is indebted to you.+ACIAIg- Turning to Paul, +ACIAIg-And Paul, how many bibles did you sell for the church last week?+ACIAIg- Paul, smiling and sticking out his chest, confidently replied,+ACIAIg- I am a professional salesman. I sold 28 bibles on behalf of the church, and here's +ACQ-280 I collected.+ACIAIg- The minister responded, +ACIAIg- That's absolutely splendid, Paul. You are truly a professional salesman and the church is also indebted to you.+ACIAIg- Apprehensively, the minister turned to Louie and said, +ACIAIg-And Louie, did you manage to sell any bibles last week?+ACIAIg- Louie silently offered the minister a large envelope. The reverend opened it and counted the contents. +ACIAIg-What is this?+ACIAIg- the minister exclaimed. +ACIAIg-Louie, there's +ACQ-3200 in here+ACE- Are you suggesting that you sold 320 bibles for the church, door to door, in just one week? Louie just nodded. That's impossible+ACEAIgAi- both Peter and Paul said in unison. +ACIAIg-We are professional salesmen, yet you claim to have sold 10 times as many bibles as we could.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Yes, this does seem unlikely,+ACIAIg- the minister agreed. +ACIAIg-I think you'd better explain how you managed to accomplish this, Louie.+ACIAIg- Louie shrugged. +ACIAIg-I+AC0-I+AC0-I+AC0- re+AC0-re+AC0-really do+AC0-do+AC0-don't kn+AC0-kn+AC0-know f+AC0-f+AC0-f+AC0-for sh +AC0-sh+AC0-sh+AC0-sure,+ACIAIg- he stammered.

My primary reason for wishing to change my status from U.S. Citizen to illegal alien stems from the bill which was recently passed by the Senate and for which you voted. If my understanding of this bill's provisions is accurate, as an illegal alien who has been in the United States for five years, all I need to do to become a citizen is to pay a +ACQ-2,000 fine and income taxes for three of the last five years. I know a good deal when I see one and I am anxious to get the process started before everyone figures it out. Simply put, those of us who have been here legally have had to pay taxes every year so I'm excited about the prospect of avoiding two years of taxes in return for paying a +ACQ-2,000 fine. Is there any way that I can apply to be illegal retroactively? This would yield an excellent result for me and my family because we paid heavy taxes in 2004 and 2005. Additionally, as an illegal alien I could begin using the local emergency room as my primary health care provider. Once I have stopped paying premiums for medical insurance, my accountant figures I could save almost +ACQ-10,000 a year. Another benefit in gaining illegal status would be that my daughter would receive preferential treatment relative to her law school applications, as well as 'in+AC0-state' tuition rates for many colleges throughout the United States for my son. Lastly, I understand that illegal status would relieve me of the burden of renewing my driver's license and making those burdensome car insurance premiums. This is very important to me given that I still have college age children driving my car. If you would provide me with an outline of the process to become illegal (retroactively if possible) and copies of the necessary forms, I would be most appreciative. Thank you for your assistance. Your Loyal Constituent, Donald Ruppert Burlington, IA+ACI-

+ACI-Joe passed away. His will provided +ACQ-30,000 for an elaborate funeral. As the last guests departed the affair, his wife, Helen, turned to her oldest friend. +ACIAIg-Well, I'm sure Joe would be pleased,+ACIAIg- she said. +ACIAIg-I'm sure you're right,+ACIAIg- replied Jody, who lowered her voice and leaned in close. +ACIAIg-How much did this really cost?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-All of it,+ACIAIg- said Helen. +ACIAIg-Thirty thousand.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No+ACEAIgAi- Jody exclaimed. +ACIAIg-I mean, it was very nice, but +ACQ-30,000?+ACIAIg- Helen answered. +ACIAIg-The funeral was +ACQ-6,500. I donated +ACQ-500 to the church. The wake, food and drinks were another +ACQ-500. The rest went for the memorial stone.+ACIAIg- Jody computed quickly. +ACIAIgAk-22,500 for a memorial stone? My God, how big is it?+ACEAIgAi- +ACIAIg-Two and a half carats.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-During its heyday the Wells Fargo Company employed a number of specialized stagecoaches such as one with a church for Sunday operation. One of the more popular models featured a darkroom on board, so passengers who took pictures could have them processed en route and the prints delivered at their destination. One day a stagecoach equipped with a darkroom was headed for Wichita when, passing through a small town, it was intercepted by the local marshal, who said, +ACIAIg-Halt in the name of the law+ACEAIgAi- +ACIAIg-What's the problem?+ACIAIg- the stagecoach driver asked. +ACIAIg-You should know that the operation of a mobile darkroom is illegal in Kansas,+ACIAIg- the marshal said. At this point two psychologists on horseback arrived on the scene. One of them said, +ACIAIg-I suppose what we have here is a classic case of the Oedipus complex.+ACIAIg- The other said, +ACIAIg-No, it's much simpler than that +AC0ALQ- it's just an arrested stage of development.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-Each Friday night after work, Bubba would fire up his outdoor grill and cook a venison steak. But all of Bubba's neighbors were Catholic....and since it was Lent, they were forbidden from eating meat on Friday. The delicious aroma from the grilled venison steaks was causing such a problem for the Catholic faithful that they finally talked to their priest. The Priest came to visit Bubba and suggested that he become a Catholic. After several classes and much study, Bubba attended Mass .and as the priest sprinkled holy water over him, he said, 'You were born a Baptist, and raised a Baptist, but now you are a Catholic.' Bubba's neighbors were greatly relieved, until Friday night arrived, and the wonderful aroma of grilled venison again filled the neighborhood. The Priest was called immediately by the neighbors and as he rushed into Bubba's yard clutching a rosary preparing to scold him, he stopped and watched in amazement. There stood Bubba, clutching a small bottle of holy water which he carefully sprinkled over the grilling meat and chanted: 'You wuz born a deer, you wuz raised a deer, but now you is a catfish.'+ACI-

+ACI-Differential Theory of US Armed Forces (Snake Model) upon encountering a snake in the Area of Operations (AO): 1. Infantry: Snake smells them, leaves area. 2. Airborne: Lands on and kills the snake. 3. Armor: Runs over snake, laughs, and looks for more snakes. 4. Aviation: Has Global Positioning Satellite coordinates to snake. Can't find snake. Returns to base for refuel, crew rest and manicure. 5. Ranger: Plays with snake, then eats it. 6. Field Artillery: Kills snake with massive Time On Target barrage with three Forward Artillery Brigades in support. Kills several hundred civilians as unavoidable collateral damage. Mission is considered a success and all participants (i.e., cooks, mechanics and clerks) are awarded Silver Stars. 7. Special Forces: Makes contact with snake, ignores all State Department directives and Theater Commander Rules of Engagement by building rapport with snake and winning its heart and mind. Trains it to kill other snakes. Files enormous travel settlement upon return. 8. Combat Engineer: Studies snake. Prepares in+AC0-depth doctrinal thesis in obscure 5 series Field Manual about how to defeat snake using countermobility assets. Complains that maneuver forces don't understand how to properly conduct doctrinal counter+AC0-snake ops. 9. Navy SEAL: Expends all ammunition and calls for naval gunfire support in failed attempt to kill snake. Snake bites SEAL and retreats to safety. Hollywood makes fantasy film in which SEALS kill Muslim extremist snakes. 10. Navy: Fires off 50 cruise missiles from various types of ships, kills snake and makes presentation to Senate Appropriations Committee on how Naval forces are the most cost+AC0-effective means of anti+AC0-snake force projection. 11. Marine: Kills snake by accident while looking for souvenirs. Local civilians demand removal of all US forces from Area of Operations. 12. Marine Recon: Follows snake, gets lost. 13. Combat Controllers: Guides snake elsewhere. 14. Para+AC0-Rescue Jumper: Wounds snake in initial encounter, then works feverishly to save snake's life. 15. Supply: (NOTICE: Your anti+AC0-snake equipment is on backorder.) 16. Transport pilot: Receives call for anti+AC0-snake equipment, and delivers two weeks after due date. 17. F+AC0-15 pilot: Mis+AC0-identifies snake as enemy Mil+AC0-24 Hind helicopter and engages with missiles. Crew chief paints snake kill on aircraft. 18. F+AC0-16 pilot: Finds snake, drops two CBU+AC0-87 cluster bombs, and misses snake target, but get direct hit on Embassy 100 KM East of snake due to weather (Too Hot also Too Cold, Was Clear but too overcast, Too dry with Rain, Unlimited ceiling with low cloud cover etc.) Claims that purchasing multi+AC0-million dollar, high+AC0-tech snake+AC0-killing device will enable it in the future to kill all snakes and achieve a revolution in military affairs. 19. AH+AC0-64 Apache pilot: Unable to locate snake, snakes don't show well on infra+AC0-red. Infrared only operable in desert AO's without power lines or SAM's. 20. UH+AC0-60 Blackhawk pilot: Finds snake on fourth pass after snake builds bonfire, pops smoke, lays out VS 17 to mark Landing Zone. Rotor wash blows snake into fire. 21. B+AC0-52 pilot: Pulls ARCLIGHT mission on snake, kills snake and every other living thing within two miles of target. 22. Missile crew: Lays in target coordinates to snake in 20 seconds, but can't receive authorization from National Command Authority to use nuclear weapons. 23. Intelligence officer: Snake? What snake? Only four of 35 indicators of snake activity are currently active. We assess the potential for snake activity as LOW. 24. Judge Advocate General (JAG): Snake declines to bite, citing grounds of professional courtesy.+ACI-

+ACI-A married couple was in a terrible accident where the woman's face was severely burned. The doctor told the husband that they couldn't graft any skin from her body because she was too skinny. So the husband offered to donate some of his own skin. However, the only skin on his body that the doctor felt was suitable would have to come from his buttocks. The husband and wife agreed that they would tell no one about where the skin came from, and requested that the doctor also honor their secret. After all, this was a very delicate matter.

The young man decided to ask if they would allow him to purchase another meal for them so that they didn't have to split theirs. The old gentleman said, +ACIAIg-Oh no.

He was coming into the Seattle airport through thick fog with less than 10 miles visibility when his instruments went out. So, he began circling around looking for a landmark. After an hour or so, he starts running pretty low on fuel and the passengers are getting very nervous. Finally, a small opening in the fog appears and he sees a tall building with one guy working alone on the fifth floor.

The lady said, +ACIAIg-Who's paying for this?+ACIAIg- Seeing the logic to this argument, a very reluctant mortician wheeled the coffin out, but then wheeled it right back in a moment later. Miraculously, the corpse was in a blue suit. After the ceremony, a well+AC0-satisfied widow complimented the undertaker on the smooth and speedy service. She especially wanted to know how he'd been able to get her husband into a blue suit so fast. The funeral director said, +ACIAIg-Oh, it was easy.

+ACI-In a small mid western conservative town, a new bar/tavern started a building to open up their business. The local Baptist church started a campaign to block the bar from opening with petitions and prayers. Work progressed, however right up till the week before opening, when a lightning strike hit the bar and it burned to the ground. The church folks were rather smug in their outlook after that, till the bar owner sued the church on the grounds that the church was ultimately responsible for the demise of his building, either through direct or indirect actions or means. The church vehemently denied all responsibility or any connection to the buildings demise in its reply to the court. As the case made it's way into court, the judge looked over the paperwork at the hearing and commented, +ACIAIg-I don't know how I'm going to decide this, but as it appears from the paperwork, we have a bar owner that believes in the power of prayer, and an entire church congregation that doesn't.+ACI-

+ACI-Some time ago Mr. Clinton was hosting a state dinner when at the last minute his regular cook took ill and they had to get a replacement at short notice. The fellow arrived and turned out to be a very grubby looking man named Jon. The President voiced his concerns to his chief of staff but was told that this was the best they could do at such short notice. Just before the meal, the President noticed the cook sticking his fingers in the soup to taste it and again he complained to the chief of staff about the cook, but he was told that this man was supposed to be a very good chef. The meal went okay but the President was sure that the soup tasted a little off, and by the time dessert came, he was starting to have stomach cramps and nausea. It was getting worse and worse till finally he had to excuse himself from the state dinner to look for the bathroom. Passing through the kitchen, he caught sight of the cook, Jon, scratching his rear end and this made him feel even worse. By now he was desperately ill with violent cramps and was so disorientated that he couldn't remember which door led to the bathroom. He was on the verge of passing out from the pain when he finally found a door that opened and as he undid his trousers and ran in, he realised to his horror that he had stumbled into Monica Lewinsky's office with his trousers around his knees. As he was just about to pass out, she bent over him and heard her president whisper in a barely audible voice, +ACIAIg-sack my cook+ACIAIg-. And that is how the whole misunderstanding occurred.+ACI-

+ACI-A housewife acquired a pet rabbit and taught it to do all kinds of tricks. She noticed, however, that the animal was very self+AC0-conscious and wouldn't perform any time it was being observed, which defeated the purpose of teaching it to do tricks in the first place. If she walked into the room when the rabbit was in the middle of a trick, it would immediately stop. The woman solved the problem by concealing a video camera behind the refrigerator and filming its tricks. She showed the tape to her all friends, except for the neighbor across the street who were on vacation and missed the show. One afternoon, the lady had to fetch something from the room where the rabbit was kept. She opened the door, and immediately the rabbit cut short a cartwheel and cowered in the corner, refusing to do any more tricks. Just then, the neighbor across the street, who had returned from vacation, knocked on the door. +ACIAIg-I understand you have a pet rabbit that does tricks?+ACIAIg- she said. +ACIAIg-You'll have to settle for video tape,+ACIAIg- the lady replied, +ACIAIg-because I've just watched my hare, and I can't do a thing with it.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-Dear Husband: I'm writing you this letter to tell you that I'm leaving you for good. I've been a good woman to you for seven years and I have nothing to show for it. These last two weeks have been hell.. Your boss called to tell me that you had quit your job today and that was the last straw. Last week, you came home and didn't notice that I had gotten my hair and nails done, cooked your favorite meal and even wore a brand new negligee. You came home and ate in two minutes, and went straight to sleep after watching the game. You don't tell me you love me anymore, you don't touch me or any thing. Either you're cheating or you don't love me anymore, whatever the case is, I'm gone. P.S. If you're trying to find me, don't. Your BROTHER and I are moving away to West Virginia together+ACE- Have a great life+ACE- Your EX+AC0-Wife Dear Ex+AC0-Wife Nothing has made my day more than receiving your letter. It's true that you and I have been married for seven years, although a good woman is a far cry from what you've been. I watch sports so much to try to drown out your constant nagging. Too bad that doesn't work. I did notice when you cut off all of your hair last week, the first thing that came to mind was +ACIAIg-You look just like a man+ACEAIgAi- My mother raised me to not say anything if you can't say anything nice. When you cooked my favorite meal, you must have gotten me confused with MY BROTHER, because I stopped eating pork seven years ago. I went to sleep on you when you had on that new negligee because the price tag was still on it. I prayed that it was a coincidence that my brother had just borrowed fifty dollars from me that morning and your negligee was +ACQ-49.99. After all of this, I still loved you and felt that we could work it out. So when I discovered that I had hit the lotto for ten million dollars, I quit my job and bought us two tickets to Jamaica. But when I got home you were gone. Everything happens for a reason I guess. I hope you have the fulfilling life you always wanted. My lawyer said with your letter that you wrote, you won't get a dime from me. So take care. P.S. I don't know if I ever told you this but Carl, my brother was born Carla. I hope that's not a problem.

The father, said quietly to his son, +ACIAIg-Go get your Mother+ACIAIg-.+ACI-
+ACI-The stockbroker received notice from the IRS that he was being audited. He showed up at the appointed time and place with all his financial records, then sat for what seemed like hours as the accountant pored over them. Finally the IRS agent looked up and commented, +ACIAIg-You must have been a tremendous fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Why would you say that?+ACIAIg- wondered the broker. +ACIAIg-Because you've made more brilliant deductions on your last three returns than Sherlock Holmes made in his entire career.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-A US Air Force C+AC0-141 was scheduled to leave Thule Air Base, Greenland at midnight. During the pilot's preflight check, he discovered that the aircraft's latrine holding tank was still full from the last flight. So a message was sent to the base, and an airman who was off duty is called out to take care of it. The young man finally got to the air base and made his way to the aircraft, only to find that the latrine pump truck had been left outdoors and was frozen solid, so he had to find another one in the hangar, which takes even more time. He returned to the aircraft and was less than enthusiastic about what he had to do. Nevertheless, he went about the pumping job deliberately and carefully (and slowly) so as to not risk criticism later. As he's left the plane, the pilot stopped him and said, +ACIAIg-Son, your attitude and performance has caused this flight to be late, and I'm going to personally see to it that you are not just reprimanded, but punished.+ACIAIg- Shivering in the cold, his task finished, the airman took a deep breath, stood up tall and said, +ACIAIg-Sir, with all due respect, I'm not your son+ADs- I'm an Airman in the United States Air Force. I've been in Thule, Greenland for 11 months without any leave, and the reindeer are beginning to look pretty good to me. I have one stripe, it's two+AC0-thirty in the morning, the temperature is 40 degrees below zero and my job here is to pump sh+ACo-t from your aircraft. Now just exactly what form of punishment did you have in mind?+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-This memo is to announce the development of a new software system which will be Year 2000 compliant. This program is known as +ACIAIg-Millennia Year Application Software System+ACIAIg- (MYASS). Next Monday there will be a meeting in which I will show MYASS to everyone. We will hold demonstrations throughout the month so that all employees will have an opportunity to get a good look at MYASS. We have not addressed networking aspects yet, so currently only one person at a time can use MYASS. This restriction will be removed after MYASS expands. Some employees have begun using the program already. This morning I walked into a subordinate's office and was not surprised to find that he had his nose buried in MYASS. Some of the less technical people may be somewhat afraid of MYASS. Last week my secretary said to me, +ACIAIg-I'm a little nervous, I never put anything in MYASS before.+ACIAIg- I helped her through the first time and afterward she admitted that it was relatively painless and she was actually looking forward to doing it again, and was even ready to kiss MYASS. There have been concerns over the virus that was found in MYASS upon initial installation, but the virus has been eliminated and we were able to save MYASS. In the future, however, protection will be required prior to entering MYASS. This database will encompass all information associated with the business. As you begin using the program, feel free to put anything you want in MYASS. As MYASS grows larger, we envision a time when it will be commonplace for a supervisor to hand work to an employee and say, +ACIAIg-here, stick this in MYASS.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-A little boy wanted +ACQ-100.00 very badly and prayed for weeks, but nothing happened Then he decided to write God a letter requesting the +ACQ-100.00 When The postal authorities received the letter addressed to : God , USA , ... they decided to send it to the President. The president was so amused that he instructed his secretary to send the little boy a +ACQ-5.00 bill. The president thought this would appear to be a lot of money to a little boy. The little boy was delighted with the +ACQ-5.00 bill and sat down and wrote a thank+AC0-you note to God, which read: Dear God , Thank you very much for sending the money. However, I noticed that for some reason you sent it through Washington, DC. Do you know those bureaucrats deducted +ACQ-95.00 in taxes+ACE-+ACI-

+ACI-A young boy had just gotten his driver's permit and enquired of his father, if they could discuss his use of the car. His father said, +ACIAIg-I'll make a deal with you. You bring your grades up from a C to a B average, study your Bible a little, get your hair cut and we'll talk about the car.+ACIAIg- Well, the boy thought about that for a moment, and settle for the offer, and they agreed on it. After about six weeks they went in to the study, where his father said, +ACIAIg-Son, I've been real proud. You've brought your grades up, and I've observed that you have been studying your Bible, and participating a lot more in the Bible study groups. But, I'm real disappointed, since you haven't gotten your hair cut.+ACIAIg- The young man paused a moment, and then said, +ACIAIg-You know, Dad, I've been thinking about that, and I've noticed in my studies of the Bible that Samson had long hair, John the Baptist had long hair, Moses had long hair and there's even a strong argument that Jesus had long hair also.+ACIAIg- To this his father replied, +ACIAIg-Did you also notice they all walked everywhere they went?+ACIAIg-+ACI-

Pretty soon all the other bats smelt the blood and began hassling him about where he got it. He told them to go way +ACE- And let him get some sleep, but they persisted until he finally gave in. +ACIAIg-OK, follow me,+ACIAIg- he said and flew out of the cave with hundreds of bats behind him. Down through a valley they went, across a river and into a forest of trees. Finally he slowed down and all the other bats excitedly milled around him. +ACIAIg-Now, do you see that tree over there?+ACIAIg- he asked. +ACIAIg-Yes, Yes, Yes+ACEAIgAi- the bats all screamed in a frenzy. +ACIAIg-Good+ACEAIgAi- said the first bat, +ACIAIg-Because I didn't+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

+ACI-I think Santa Claus is a woman .... I hate to be the one to defy sacred myth, but I believe he's a she. Think about it. Christmas is a big, organized, warm, fuzzy, nurturing social deal, and I have a tough time believing a guy could possibly pull it all off+ACE- For starters, the vast majority of men don't even think about selecting gifts until Christmas Eve. It's as if they are all frozen in some kind of Ebenezerian Time Warp until 3 p.m. on Dec. 24th, when they +AC0- with amazing calm +AC0- call other errant men and plan for a last+AC0-minute shopping spree. Once at the mall, they always seem suprised to find only Ronco products, socket wrench sets, and mood rings left on the shelves. (You might think this would send them into a fit of panic and guilt, but my husband tells me it's an enormous relief because it lessens the 11th hour decision+AC0-making burden.) on this count alone, I'm convinced Santa is a woman. Surely, if he were a man, everyone in the universe would wake up Christmas morning to find a rotating musical Chia Pet under the tree, still in the bag. Another problem for a he+AC0-Santa would be getting there. First of all, there would be no reindeer because they would all be dead, gutted and strapped on to the rear bumper of the sleigh amid wide+AC0-eyed, desperate claims that buck season had been extended. Blitzen's rack would already be on the way to the taxidermist. Even if the male Santa DID have reindeer, he'd still have transportation problems because he would inevitably get lost up there in the snow and clouds and then refuse to stop and ask for directions. Add to this the fact there would be unavoidable delays in the chimney, where the Bob Vila+AC0-like Santa would stop to inspect and repoint bricks in the flue. He would also need to check for carbon monoxide fumes in every gas fireplace, and get under every Christmas tree that is crooked to straighten it to a perfectly upright 90+AC0-degree angle. Other reasons why Santa can't possibly be a man: +AC0- Men can't pack a bag. +AC0- Men would rather be dead than caught wearing red velvet. +AC0- Men would feel their masculinity is threatened.. having to be seen with all those elves. +AC0- Men don't answer their mail. +AC0- Men would refuse to allow their physique to be described even in jest as anything remotely resembling a +ACIAIg-bowl full of jelly.+ACIAIg- +AC0- Men aren't interested in stockings unless somebody's wearing them. +AC0- Having to do the Ho Ho Ho thing would seriously inhibit their ability to pick up women. +AC0- Finally, being responsible for Christmas would require a commitment. I can buy the fact that other mythical holiday characters are men ...... Father Time shows up once a year unshaven and looking ominous. Definite guy. Cupid flies around carrying weapons. Uncle Sam is a politician who likes to point fingers. Any one of these individuals could pass the testosterone screening test. But not St. Nick. Not a chance. As long as we have each other, goodwill, peace on earth, faith and Nat King Cole's version of +ACIAIg-The Christmas Song+ACIAIg- it probably makes little difference what gender Santa is.

+ACI-Two weeks ago was my 45th birthday and I wasn't feeling too good that morning. I went to breakfast knowing my wife would be pleasant and say, +ACIAIg-Happy Birthday+ACEAIgAi-, and probably have a present for me. As it turned out, she didn't even say good morning, let alone any happy birthday. I thought, well, that's wives for you, the children will remember. The children came in to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I was feeling pretty low and despondent. As Iwalked into my office, my secretary Janet said, +ACIAIg-Good morning, Boss. Happy Birthday+ACEAIgAi-. And I felt a little better that someone had remembered. I worked until noon, then Janet knocked on my door and said,+ACIAIg-You know, it's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your birthday...let's go to lunch, just you and me.+ACIAIg- I said, +ACIAIg-By George, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go+ACEAIgAi- We went to lunch. We didn't go where we normally go+ADs- instead we went out to a private place. We had two martinis and enjoyed lunch tremendously. On the way back to the office, she said, +ACIAIg-You know, it's such a beautiful day. We don't need to go back to the office, do we?+ACIAIg- I said, +ACIAIg-No, I guess not.+ACIAIg- She said, +ACIAIg-Let's go to my apartment.+ACIAIg- After arriving at her apartment she said, +ACIAIg-Boss, if you don't mind, I think I'll go into the bedroom and slip into something more comfortable.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Sure+ACEAIgAi- I excitedly replied. She went into the bedroom and, in about six minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake...... followed by my wife, children, dozens of our friends, all singing Happy Birthday.......

+ACI-There was a mine in a small town that completely collapsed. One of the engineers who miraculously survived the disaster went into the local watering hole. The bar was empty except for one lonely soul at the other end of the bar. +ACIAIg-Hey bartender+ACIAIg- said the Engineer, +ACIAIg-I'll have a beer and pour another one for my friend down at the end there.+ACIAIg- The bartender responded, +ACIAIg-I'm sorry sir but that guy's a commie and we don't serve his kind around here.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Well, you'd better because if it weren't for that guy, I wouldn't be here. You remember that mine that caved in, well I was in that mine and so was that guy. When the last of us were escaping, he held the roof of the mine up with his head+ACE- So get him a beer and if you don't believe me, look at the top of his head and you'll see that it's flat from holding the roof up.+ACIAIg- The bartender skeptically served the commie his beer and then came back to talk to the Engineer: +ACIAIg-I saw the flat spot on his head but I also couldn't help noticing the bruising under his chin. What is that all about?+ACIAIg- The engineer responded: +ACIAIg-Oh...that's where we put the jack.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-Top brass from the Army, Navy and Marine Corps were arguing about who had the bravest troops. They decided to settle the dispute using an enlisted man from each branch. The Army General called a private over and ordered him to climb to the top of the base flagpole while singing +ACIAIg-The Caissons Go Rolling Along,+ACIAIg- then let go with both hands, and salute. The private quickly complied. Next, the Admiral ordered a sailor to climb the pole, polish the brass knob at the top, sing +ACIAIg-Anchors Aweigh,+ACIAIg- salute smartly and jump off. The sailor did as he was told and landed on the concrete below. Finally, the marine was told to do exactly as the army and navy men had done, but in full battle gear, pack filled with bricks, loaded weapon carried high. He took one look at the Marine General and said, +ACIAIg-You're out of your mind, sir+ACEAIgAi- The marine commander turned to the others. +ACIAIg-Now THAT'S guts+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

+ACI-Seems God was just about done with creating the universe but he had two extra things left over in his bag so he decided to split them between Adam and Eve. He told them that one of the things he had left was a thing that would allow the owner to pee while standing up. +ACIAIg-It's a very handy thing,+ACIAIg- God told them, +ACIAIg-and I was wondering if either one of you would like that.+ACIAIg- When Adam saw it, he jumped up and down and begged +ACIAIg-Oh, give that to me+ACE- I'd love to have that. It seems just the sort of thing a man should be have. Please. Please+ACE- Pleeease+ACE- Give it to me.+ACIAIg- On and on he went like an excited little boy. So Eve just smiled and told God that if Adam really wanted it so badly, he should have it. So God gave Adam the thing that allowed him to pee while standing up and he was so excited. He whizzed on the bark of a tree and then went off to write his name in the sand, laughing with delight all the while. God and Eve watched him for a moment and then God said to Eve, +ACIAIg-Well, here's the other thing and I guess you can have it.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-What's it called? Eve asked. +ACIAIg-Brains+ACIAIg- God said.+ACI-

They spent a couple of days and nights on the farm of what would be considered a very poor family.

The son answered, +ACIAIg-I saw that we have one dog and they had four. We have a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden and they have a creek that has no end. We have imported lanterns in our garden and they have the stars at night. Our patio reaches to the front yard and they have the whole horizon. We have a small piece of land to live on and they have fields that go beyond our sight. We have servants who serve us, but they serve others. We buy our food, but they grow theirs. We have walls around our property to protect us, they have friends to protect them.+ACIAIg- With this the boy's father was speechless. Then his son added, +ACIAIg-Thanks dad for showing me how poor we are.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

After resuming the journey and a bit of small talk, the Navajo woman noticed a brown bag on the seat next to Sally. +ACIAIg-What's in the bag?+ACIAIg- asked the old woman.

+ACI-When you occasionally have a really bad day, and you just need to take it out on someone, don't take it out on someone you know, take it out on someone you don't know. I was sitting at my desk when I remembered a phone call I had forgotten to make. I found the number and dialed it. A man answered, saying, +ACIAIg-Hello.+ACIAIg- I politely said, +ACIAIg-This is Andrew. Could I please speak with Robin Carter?+ACIAIg- Suddenly, the phone was slammed down on me. I couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude. I tracked down Robin's correct number and called her. I had transposed the last two digits of her phone number. After hanging up with her, I decided to call the 'wrong' number again. When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled, +ACIAIg-You're an assh+ACo-le+ACEAIgAi- and hung up. I wrote his number down with the word 'assh+ACo-le' next to it, and put it in my desk drawer. Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, I'd call him up and yell, +ACIAIg-You're an assh+ACo-le+ACEAIgAi- It always cheered me up. When Caller ID came to our area, I thought my therapeutic 'assh+ACo-le' calling would have to stop. So, I called his number and said, +ACIAIg-Hi, this is John Smith from the Telephone Company. I'm just calling to see if you're familiar with the Caller ID program?+ACIAIg- He yelled, +ACIAIg-NO+ACEAIgAi- and slammed the phone down. I quickly called him back and said, +ACIAIg-That's because you're an assh+ACo-le+ACEAIgAi- One day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for. I hit the horn and yelled that I had been waiting for the spot. The idiot ignored me. I noticed a +ACIAIg-For Sale+ACIAIg- sign in his car window ...so, I wrote down his number. A couple of days later, right after calling the first assh+ACo-le, (I had his number on speed dial), I thought I had better call the BMW assh+ACo-le too. I said, +ACIAIg-Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Yes, it is.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Can you tell me where I can see it?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Yes, I live at 1802 West 34th Street.

Now, when I had a problem, I had two assh+ACo-les to call. But after several months of calling them, it wasn't as enjoyable as it used to be. So, I came up with an idea. I called Assh+ACo-le +ACM-1. +ACIAIg-Hello.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-You're an assh+ACo-le+ACEAIgAi- (But I didn't hang up.) +ACIAIg-Are you still there?+ACIAIg- he asked. +ACIAIg-Yeah,+ACIAIg- I said. +ACIAIg-Stop calling me,+ACIAIg- he screamed. +ACIAIg-Make me,+ACIAIg- I said. +ACIAIg-Who are you?+ACIAIg- he asked. +ACIAIg-My name is Don Hansen.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Yeah? Where do you live?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Asshole, I live at 1802 West 34th Street, a yellow house, with my black beamer parked in front.+ACIAIg- He said, +ACIAIg-I'm coming over right now, Don. And you had better start saying your prayers.+ACIAIg- I said, +ACIAIg-Yeah, like I'm really scared, assh+ACo-le.+ACIAIg- Then I called Assh+ACo-le +ACM-2. +ACIAIg-Hello?+ACIAIg- he said. +ACIAIg-Hello, assh+ACo-le,+ACIAIg- I said. He yelled, +ACIAIg-If I ever find out who you are...+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-You'll what?+ACIAIg- I said. +ACIAIg-I'll kick your ass,+ACIAIg- he exclaimed. I answered, +ACIAIg-Well, asshole, here's your chance. I'm coming over right now.+ACIAIg- Then I hung up and immediately called the police, saying that I lived at 1802 West 34th Street, and that I was on my way over there to kill my gay lover. Then I called Channel 13 News about the gang war going down on West 34th Street. I quickly got into my car and headed over to 34th street. There I saw two assh+ACo-les beating the crap out of each other in front of six squad cars, a police helicopter, and news crew. NOW, I feel better+ACE- Anger management at it's very best.+ACI-

As my men were pulling me out, a shark bit my leg off.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Wow+ACEAIgAi- says the soldier. +ACIAIg-What about your hook?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Well,+ACIAIg- answers the pirate, +ACIAIg-we were boarding a ship when one of the enemies chopped off my hand.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Incredible+ACEAIgAi- the soldier exclaims, +ACIAIg-How'd you get the eye patch?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-A seagull pooped in my eye,+ACIAIg- the pirate replies. +ACIAIg-You lost your eye to seagull poop?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Well,+ACIAIg- says the pirate, +ACIAIg-it was my first day with the new hook.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-Jesus has been crucifixed and reappears to his disciples. He tells them that he will grant them a wish before he ascends into heaven. The disciples get together and confer. After much arguing Peter says +ACIAIg-Could you do that walking on water thing again? It was so cool+ACIAIg-. Jesus smiles, agrees and the next day they set out onto the sea of Gallilee in Peter's boat. They stop far from the shore and Jesus steps off the side of the boat onto the water. He immediately disappears under the surface and the disciples rush to drag him back into the better. Jesus looks flustered, but vows to have a second go. Once again he steps off the boat and sinks quickly below the surface. The disciples drag him back and apologize for having asked him to walk on water. But Peter begins to doubt in the Messiah and can't help asking why Jesus can't repeat the miracle. +ACIAIg-Oh, I can+ACIAIg-, Jesus insists, +ACIAIg-at least I could before I had these bloody holes in my feet+ACIAIg-.+ACI-
+ACI-A very shy guy goes into a bar and sees a beautiful woman sitting at the bar. After an hour of gathering up his courage he finally goes over to her and asks, tentatively, +ACIAIg-Um, would you mind if I chatted with you for a while?+ACIAIg- She responds by yelling, at the top of her lungs, +ACIAIg-No, I won't sleep with you tonight+ACEAIgAi- Everyone in the bar is now staring at them. Naturally, the guy is hopelessly and completely embarrassed and he slinks back to his table. After a few minutes, the woman walks over to him and apologizes. She smiles at him and says, +ACIAIg-I'm sorry if I embarrassed you. You see, I'm a graduate student in psychology and I'm studying how people respond to embarrassing situations.+ACIAIg- To which he responds, at the top of his lungs, +ACIAIg-What do you mean +ACQ-200?+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-Your accountants letter of resignation is postmarked Zurich. You have to hitch hike to the bank to make your car payment. Your suggestion box starts ticking. Your secretary tells you the FBI is on line 1, the DA is on line 2, and CBS is on line 3. You see your stockbroker hitchhiking out of town. You see the captain running toward the railing wearing a life jacket. They pay your wages out of petty cash. You make more than you ever made, owe more than you ever owed, and have less than you've ever had. You tell the barber what you think about his prices before you get your haircut. Getting there is half the fun and three+AC0-fourths of the vacation budget. The simple instructions enclosed aren't. A black cat crosses you path and drops dead. You take an assertiveness training course and you're afraid to tell your wife. The plumber floats by on your kitchen table. Your pacemaker has only a thirty day guarantee. The candles on your cake set off your smoke alarm. The pest exterminator crawls under your house and never comes out.+ACI-
+ACI-A trucker came into a truck stop cafe and placed his order. He said, +ACIAIg-I want three flat tires, a pair of headlights and pair of running boards.+ACIAIg- The brand new blonde waitress, not wanting to appear stupid, went to the kitchen and said to the cook, +ACIAIg-This guy out there just ordered three flat tires, a pair of headlights and a pair of running boards. What does he think this place is, an auto parts store?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No,+ACIAIg- the cook said. +ACIAIg-Three flat tires mean three pancakes, a pair of headlights is two eggs sunny side up, and running boards are 2 slices of crisp bacon.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Oh, OK+ACEAIgAi- said the blonde. She thought about it for a moment and then spooned up a bowl of beans and gave it to the customer. The trucker asked, +ACIAIg-What are the beans for, Blondie?+ACIAIg- She replied, +ACIAIg-I thought while you were waiting for the flat tires, headlights and running boards, you might as well gas up+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-
+ACI-At first, I didn't think this qualified as a joke, then I checked my bank balance+ACE- For the record, I am in no way responsible for the accuracy of these figures, I just paste 'em as I finds 'em+ACEAIQ- Michael Jordan having +ACIAIg-retired,+ACIAIg- with +ACQ-40 million in endorsements, makes +ACQ-178,100 a day, working or not. If he s 7 hours a night, he makes +ACQ-52,000 every night while visions of sugarplums dance in his head. If he goes to see a movie, it'll cost him +ACQ-7.00, but he'll make +ACQ-18,550 while he's there. If he decides to have a 5 minute egg, he'll make +ACQ-618 while boiling it. He makes +ACQ-7,415/hr more than minimum wage. He'll make +ACQ-3,710 while watching each episode of Friends. If he wanted to save up for a new Acura NSX (+ACQ-90,000) it would take him a whole 12 hours. If someone were to hand him his salary and endorsement money, they would have to do it at the rate of +ACQ-2.00 every second. He'll probably pay around +ACQ-200 for a nice round of golf, but will be reimbursed +ACQ-33,390 for that round. Assuming he puts the federal maximum of 15+ACU- of his income into a tax deferred account (401k), his contributions will hit the federal cap of +ACQ-9500 at 8:30 a.m. on January 1st. If you were given a penny for every 10 dollars he made, you 'd be living comfortably at +ACQ-65,000 a year. He'll make about +ACQ-19.60 while watching the 100 meter dash in the Olympics, and about +ACQ-15,600 during the Boston Marathon. While the common person is spending about +ACQ-20 for a meal in his trendy Chicago restaurant, he'll pull in about +ACQ-5600. This year, he'll make more than twice as much as all U.S. past presidents for all of their terms combined. Amazing isn't it? However... If Jordan saves 100+ACU- of his income for the next 450 years, he'll still have less than Bill Gates has today.+ACI-

The following Sunday, he watched as the offering was collected and saw a little old lady put the distinctive pink envelope in the plate. This went on for weeks until the pastor, overcome by curiosity, approached her. +ACIAIg-Ma'am, I couldn't help but notice that you put +ACQ-1,000 a week in the collection plate,+ACIAIg- he stated. +ACIAIg-Why yes,+ACIAIg- she replied, +ACIAIg-every week my son sends me money, and I give some of it to the church.+ACIAIg- The pastor replied, +ACIAIg-That's wonderful, how much does he send you?+ACIAIg- The old lady said, +ACIAIgAk-10,000 a week.+ACIAIg- The pastor was amazed. +ACIAIg-Your son is very successful+ADs- what does he do for a living?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-He is a veterinarian,+ACIAIg- she answered. +ACIAIg-That is an honorable profession,+ACIAIg- the pastor said. +ACIAIg-Where does he practice?+ACIAIg- The old lady said proudly, +ACIAIg-In Nevada.

After a minute she looked up from her terminal with a frown and said that she would be unable to cash his check. +ACIAIg-Why not?+ACIAIg- my friend asked incredulously. +ACIAIg-I'm sorry, sir,+ACIAIg- she replied, +ACIAIg-but our computer indicates that you do not have sufficient funds to cover this amount. As a matter of fact,+ACIAIg- she continued, +ACIAIg-our records show your account overdrawn in excess of +ACQ-5000.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-It CAN'T be+ACEAIgAi- he cried. +ACIAIg-You have GOT to be kidding+ACEAIgAi- +ACIAIg-Yes, I am,+ACIAIg- she answered with a big smile, counting out his cash. +ACIAIg-But you will notice that your hiccups are gone.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

A salesman showed him the latest model chain saw and assured him that he could easily cut three or four cords of wood per day with it. But the first day, Bubba barely cut one cord of wood. The second morning he arose an hour earlier and managed to cut a little over one cord. The third day he got up even earlier but only managed to achieve a total of 1 12 cords of wood. Bubba returned the saw to the store the next day and explained the situation. +ACIAIg-Well+ACIAIg-, said the salesman, +ACIAIg-let's see what's the matter.+ACIAIg- He then pulled the cable and the chain saw sprang into action.

+ACI-A filthy rich Florida man decided that he wanted to throw a party and invited all of his buddies and neighbors. He also invited Leroy, the only Redneck in the neighborhood. He held the party around the pool in the backyard of his mansion. Leroy was having a good time drinking, dancing, eating shrimp, oysters and BBQ and flirting with all the women. At the height of the party, the host said, 'I have a 10 foot man+AC0-eating gator in my pool and I'll give a million dollars to anyone who has the nerve to jump in. The words were barely out of his mouth when there was a loud splash. Everyone turned around and saw Leroy in the pool+ACE- Leroy was fighting the gator and kicking its rear+ACE- Leroy was jabbing it in the eyes with his thumbs, throwing punches, head butts and choke holds, biting the gator on the tail and flipping it through the air like some kind of Judo Instructor. The water was churning and splashing everywhere. Both Leroy and the gator were screaming and raising heck. Finally Leroy strangled the gator and let it float to the top like a dime store goldfish. Leroy then slowly climbed out of the pool. Everybody was just staring at him in disbelief. Finally the host says, 'Well, Leroy, I reckon I owe you a million dollars.' 'No, that's okay. I don't want It,' said Leroy. The rich man said, 'Man, I have to give you something you won the bet. How about half a million bucks then? No thanks, I don't want it,' answered Leroy. The host said, 'Come on, I insist on giving you something. That was amazing. How about a new Porsche and a Rolex and some stock options?' Again Leroy said no. Confused, the rich man asked, 'Well, Leroy, then what do you want?' Leroy said, 'I want the name of the sumbich who pushed me in the pool+ACE-'+ACI-

COSTELLO: I'm going to click your big W if you don't give me a straight answer. Let's forget about words for a minute. What do I need if I want to watch a movie over the Internet? ABBOT: RealOne. COSTELLO: Maybe a real movie, maybe a cartoon. What I watch is none of your business. But what do I need to watch it? ABBOT: RealOne. COSTELLO: If it's a long movie I'll also want to watch reels two, three and four. Can I watch reel four? ABBOT: Of course. COSTELLO: Great+ACE- With what? ABBOT: RealOne. COSTELLO: Okay, so I'm sitting at my computer and I want to watch a movie. What do I do? ABBOT: You click the blue 1. COSTELLO: I click the blue one what? ABBOT: The blue 1.

ABBOT: Yes, although to be fair there aren't many other Words left. It pretty much wiped out all the other Words. COSTELLO: And that word is the real one? ABBOT: No. Real One has nothing to do with Word. Real One isn't even part of Office. COSTELLO: Never mind+ADs- I don't want to get started with that again. But I also need something for bank accounts, loans, and so on. What do you have to help me track my money? ABBOT: Money. COSTELLO: That's right. What do you have? ABBOT: Money.

COSTELLO: I get a copy of money. Isn't that illegal? ABBOT: No. We have a license from Microsoft to make copies of Money. COSTELLO: Microsoft can license you to make money? ABBOT: Why not? They own it. COSTELLO: Well, it's great that I'm going to get free money, but I'll still need to track it. Do you have anything for managing your money? ABBOT: Managing Your Money? That program disappeared years ago. COSTELLO: Well, what do you sell in its place? ABBOT: Money. COSTELLO: You sell money? ABBOT: Of course. But if you buy a computer from us, you get it for free. COSTELLO: That's all very wonderful, but I'll be running a business. Do you have any software for, you know, accounting? ABBOT: Simply Accounting. COSTELLO: Probably, but it might get a little complicated. ABBOT: If you don't want Simply Accounting, you might try M.Y.O.B. COSTELLO: M.Y.O.B.? What does that stand for? ABBOT: Mind Your Own Business. COSTELLO: I beg your pardon? ABBOT: No, that would be I.B.Y.P. I said M.Y.O.B. COSTELLO: Look, I just need to do some accounting for my home business. You know+AC0ALQ-accounting? You do it with money. ABBOT: Of course you can do accounting with Money. But you may need more. COSTELLO: More money? ABBOT: More than Money. Money can't do everything. COSTELLO: I don't need a sermon+ACE- Okay, let's forget about money for the moment. I'm worried that my computer might... what's the word? Crash. And if my computer crashes, what can I use to restore my data? ABBOT: Go Back. COSTELLO: Okay. I'm worried about my computer smashing and I need something to restore my data. What do you recommend? ABBOT: Go Back. COSTELLO: How many times do I have to repeat myself? ABBOT: I've never asked you to repeat yourself. All I said was Go Back.

+ACI-Captain Kidd prepared with his crew to search for buried treasure. Before setting out he consulted with his dentist, who advised him that all the best treasure out there was in the gold fillings of the teeth of various bodies, such as he might find in a cemetery or at the site of some battlefield. He kept this advice secret from his crew, and so when they landed on a desert island, they scattered, each using his own preferred means of treasure hunting, while Captain Kidd looked for cemeteries. He found several, dug up the bodies, and extracted many gold fillings from many teeth. He also came upon an old battlefield, and by exhuming the bodies there he was able to find still more gold fillings.

+ACI-A young man who was also an avid golfer found himself with a few hours to spare one afternoon. He figured if he hurried and played very fast, he could get in 9 holes before he had to head home. Just as he was about to tee off an old gentleman shuffled onto the tee and asked if he could accompany the young man as he was golfing alone. Not being able to say no, he allowed the old gent to join him. To his surprise the old man played fairly quickly. He didn't hit the ball far, but plodded along consistently and didn't waste much time. Finally, they reached the 9th fairway and the young man found himself with a tough shot. There was a large pine tree right in front of his ball and it was directly between his ball and the green. After several minutes of debating how to hit the shot the old man finally said, +ACIAIg-You know, when I was your age I'd hit the ball right over that tree.+ACIAIg- With that challenge placed before him, the youngster swung hard, hit the ball up, right smack into the top of the tree trunk and it thudded back on the ground not a foot from where it had originally lay. The old man offered one more comment, +ACIAIg-Of course, when I was your age that pine tree was only 3 feet tall.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-After 17 years of marriage, a man dumped his wife for a younger woman. The house was in his name and he wanted to remain there with his new love so he asked the wife to move out and then he would buy her another place. The wife agreed to this, but asked that she be given 3 days on her own there, to pack up her things. While he was gone, the first day she lovingly put her personal belongings into boxes and crates and suitcases. On the second day, she had the movers come and collect her things. On the third day, she sat down for the last time at their candlelit dining table, soft music playing in the background, and feasted on a pound of shrimp and a bottle of Chardonnay. When she had finished, she went into each room and deposited a few of the resulting shrimp shells into the hollow of the curtain rods. She then cleaned up the kitchen and left. The husband came back, with his new girl, and all was bliss for the first few days. Then it started+ADs- slowly but surely. Clueless, the man could not explain why the place smelled so bad.

+ACI-A Russian and an American wrestler were set to square off for the Olympic Gold Medal. Before the final match, the American wrestler's trainer came to him and said, +ACIAIg-now, don't forget all the research we've done on this Russian. He's never lost a match because of this 'Pretzel' hold he has, whatever you do don't let him get you in this hold+ACE- If he does, you're finished+ACEAIgAi- The wrestler nodded in acknowledgment. As the match started, the American and the Russian circled each other several times, looking for an opening. All of a sudden, the Russian lunged forward, grabbing the American and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold. A sigh of disappointment arose from the crowd and the trainer buried his face in his hands, for he knew all was lost. He couldn't watch the inevitable happen. Suddenly, there was a scream, then a cheer from the crowd and the trainer raised his eyes just in time to watch the Russian go flying up in the air. His back hit the mat with a thud and the American collapsed on top of him making the pin and winning the match. The trainer was astounded. When he finally got the American wrestler alone, he asked, +ACIAIg-how did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before+ACEAIgAi- The wrestler answered,+ACIAIg-well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of testicles right in front of my face.

+ACI-Hellmann's Mayonnaise +AC0- a bit of history. Most people don't know that back in 1912, Hellmann's mayonnaise was manufactured in England . In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York . This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico . But as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York . The ship hit an iceberg and sank, and the cargo was forever lost. The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning, which they still observe to this day. The National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5th and is known, of course, as +AC0- Sinko De Mayo.+ACI-
+ACI-The woman entered the room, and with a knowing smile teasing her full lips,she sank into the comfort of the plush chair in the corner. The handsome stranger turned, having sensed her approach.Locking his steely gray eyes on hers, he moved slowly toward her,his experienced gaze measuring her, hypnotizing her with his soft murmurs of assurance. He sank to his knees before her and without a word, smoothly released her from her constraining attire.With a sigh of surrender, she allowed his foreign hands to unleash her bare flesh. He expertly guided his hands through this tender,often hidden territory, his movements deliberate, confident in his ability to satisfy her every need. Her senses swam.She was overcome with an aching desire that had gone unfulfilled for so long. And, just as it seemed that ecstasy was within her grasp, he paused, and for one heart+AC0-stopping moment, she thought,+ACIAIg-It's too big+ACE-.....it will never fit+ACEAIgAi- Then, with a sudden rush, it slid into place as if it had been made only for her. As pleasure and contentment washed over her, she met his steady gaze, tears of gratitude shining in her eyes. And he knew it wouldn't be long before she returned. Oh, yes, this woman would want more.She would want to do it again and again and again. Because she loves shopping for shoes....+ACI-

The guy answered, +ACIAIg-Because the poor fool is thinking about getting married.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

The biker asks her +ACIAIg-Do you smoke?+ACIAIg- The little old lady says +ACIAIg-Yea, I smoke. I smoke 4 packs of cigarettes a day and a couple of cigars while I'm shooting pool.+ACIAIg- The biker is impressed and asks +ACIAIg-Well, have you ever been picked up by the Fuzz?+ACIAIg- The little old lady says +ACIAIg-No, never been picked up by the fuzz, but I've been swung around by my nipples a few times.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

How did you know+ACIAIg- the golfer asked. +ACIAIg-Well,+ACIAIg- said the policeman very seriously, +ACIAIg-Your ball flew out onto the highway and crashed through a driver's windshield. The car went out of control, crashing into five other cars and a fire truck. The fire truck couldn't make it to the fire, and the building burned down. So, what are you going to do about it+ACIAIg- The golfer thought it over carefully and responded, +ACIAIg-I think I'll close my stance a little bit, tighten my grip and lower my right thumb.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-So, there's this lawyer who dies and goes to Hell. The lawyer sits in the waiting room for hours, then Satan finally gets to him. +ACIAIg-Welcome to Hell,+ACIAIg- Satan says. +ACIAIg-Have you decided what your Hell is going to be yet?+ACIAIg- The lawyer, confused, says, +ACIAIg-Well, no. What do you mean?+ACIAIg- Satan replies, +ACIAIg-Well, we have different types of hell based on your life experiences. You were a lawyer, right? Well, you need to choose between Door A and Door B. Go ahead and think about it. I'll be back in awhile to hear your decision.+ACIAIg- Well, the lawyer gets up and opens Door A. Inside is a courtroom where the judge is yelling, slamming his gavel, and ruling against every case the poor lawyers inside present. The clients are wailing, the lawyers are crying+ADs- it's just terrible+ACE- +ACIAIg-Hmm,+ACIAIg- the lawyer thinks, +ACIAIg-That certainly doesn't look too good. I wonder what Door B has?+ACIAIg- Inside Door B the lawyer sees client after client passing lawyers by for other, unknown counsel. No matter how hard they try, no matter how many ambulances they chase, they can't secure a client. It doesn't take long for the lawyers to turn on each other, maiming and wounding one another in an effort to be the most attractive to the clients. +ACIAIg-Well, I certainly don't want to spend my eternity in this room of desperation and greed,+ACIAIg- the lawyer thinks. So what to do? Off to the side of the two doors, the lawyer sees another unmarked door. Curious, he sneaks a peek inside that room. Inside is a beautiful office filled with spectacular furnishings, state of the art equipment, piles of money, and the most gorgeous legal assistants you can imagine. The lawyers inside sit back and count their money while these wonderful assistants do all the work for them, and in no time at all+ACEAIQ- If a lawyer complains of a headache, one of the beautiful assistants massages his temple. If a lawyer wants something to eat or drink, the legal assistant fetches it immediately. If a lawyer complains of sore feet, the legal assistant rubs his feet. +ACIAIg-Now THAT'S more like it+ACEAIQAiACI- the lawyer says to himself. When Satan returns awhile later, he asks the lawyer which door, A or B he wants to spend eternity in.

+ACI-A principal of a small middle school had a problem with a few of the older girls starting to use lipstick. When applying it in the bathroom they would then press their lips to the mirror and leave lip prints. Before it got out of hand he thought of a way to stop it. He gathered all the girls together that wore lipstick and told them he wanted to meet with them in the ladies room at 2pm. They gathered at 2pm and found the principal and the school custodian waiting for them. The principal explained that it was becoming a problem for the custodian to clean the mirror every night. He said he felt the ladies did not fully understand just how much of a problem it was and he wanted them to witness just how hard it was to clean. The custodian then demonstrated. He took a long brush on a handle out of a box. He then dipped the brush in the nearest toilet, moved to the mirror and proceeded to remove the lipstick. That was the last day the girls pressed their lips on the mirror.+ACI-

Israeli scientists were outraged. They dug 50, 100 and 200 metres underground, but found absolutely nothing......They concluded that the ancient Hebrews 55,000 years ago had cellular telephones.+ACI-

+ACI-Standing at the edge of the lake, a man saw his wife flailing about in the deep water. Unable to swim, the man started to scream for help. A trout fisherman ran up. The man said, +ACIAIg-My wife is drowning and I can't swim. Please save her. I'll give you a hundred dollars.+ACIAIg- The fisherman dove into the water. In ten powerful strokes, he reached the woman, put his arm around her, and swam back to shore. Depositing her at the feet of the man, the fisherman said, +ACIAIg-Okay, where's my hundred?+ACIAIg- The man said, +ACIAIg-Look, when I saw her going down for the third time, I thought it was my wife.

+ACI-Two women in the one horse town of Parched Gulch had daughters, each of marriageable age. But there were no prospective husbands in town due to shootings, running off with outlaws and drunk riding. And there was no chance at all of any bridegrooms turning up. The two mothers pooled their meager resources, advertised, and sure enough, they got results: twin brothers in Cactus Corners looking for wives. The twin bridegrooms were sent for. Along the way the twins met up with outlaws. One was killed, the other escaped. Upon his arrival, the mothers were in immediate conflict as to whom the surviving twin belonged. They were going to kill each other over it. After all, each had a daughter's future at stake. They took the case to Judge A.K. Hornswoggle, alcoholic, disbarred, but with Solomonic frontier wisdom. After due deliberation, Hornswoggle ruled that the young man be chopped in half and one half awarded to each daughter. The first mother was outraged. If Hornswoggle wasn't drunk or stupid, he was a monster for suggesting such a thing. The second mother thought it would not be a bad solution. And pointing to the second mother, Hornswoggle said, +ACIAIg-Your daughter gets him. You are the real mother+AC0-in+AC0-law.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-A minister concluded that his church was getting into serious financial troubles. While checking the church storeroom, he discovered several cartons of new bibles that had never been opened and distributed. So at his Sunday sermon, he asked for three volunteers from the congregation who would be willing to sell the bibles door+AC0-to+AC0-door for +ACQ-10 each to raise the desperately needed money for the church. Peter, Paul and Louie all raised their hands to volunteer for the task. The minister knew that Peter and Paul earned their living as salesmen and were likely capable of selling some bibles. But he had serious doubts about Louie who was a local farmer, who had always kept to himself because he was embarrassed by his speech impediment. Poor Louis stuttered badly. But, not wanting to discourage Louis, the minister decided to let him try anyway. He sent the three of them away with the back seat of their cars stacked with bibles. He asked them to meet with him and report the results of their door+AC0-to+AC0-door selling efforts the following Sunday. Anxious to find out how successful they were, the minister immediately asked Peter, +ACIAIg-Well, Peter, how did you make out selling our bibles last week?+ACIAIg- Proudly handing the reverend an envelope, Peter replied, +ACIAIg-Using my sales prowess, I was able to sell 20 bibles, and here's the +ACQ-200 I collected on behalf of the church.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Fine job, Peter+ACEAIgAi- The minister said, vigorously shaking his hand. +ACIAIg-You are indeed a fine salesman and the Church is indebted to you.+ACIAIg- Turning to Paul, +ACIAIg-And Paul, how many bibles did you sell for the church last week?+ACIAIg- Paul, smiling and sticking out his chest, confidently replied,+ACIAIg- I am a professional salesman. I sold 28 bibles on behalf of the church, and here's +ACQ-280 I collected.+ACIAIg- The minister responded, +ACIAIg- That's absolutely splendid, Paul. You are truly a professional salesman and the church is also indebted to you.+ACIAIg- Apprehensively, the minister turned to Louie and said, +ACIAIg-And Louie, did you manage to sell any bibles last week?+ACIAIg- Louie silently offered the minister a large envelope. The reverend opened it and counted the contents. +ACIAIg-What is this?+ACIAIg- the minister exclaimed. +ACIAIg-Louie, there's +ACQ-3200 in here+ACE- Are you suggesting that you sold 320 bibles for the church, door to door, in just one week? Louie just nodded. That's impossible+ACEAIgAi- both Peter and Paul said in unison. +ACIAIg-We are professional salesmen, yet you claim to have sold 10 times as many bibles as we could.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Yes, this does seem unlikely,+ACIAIg- the minister agreed. +ACIAIg-I think you'd better explain how you managed to accomplish this, Louie.+ACIAIg- Louie shrugged. +ACIAIg-I+AC0-I+AC0-I+AC0- re+AC0-re+AC0-really do+AC0-do+AC0-don't kn+AC0-kn+AC0-know f+AC0-f+AC0-f+AC0-for sh +AC0-sh+AC0-sh+AC0-sure,+ACIAIg- he stammered.

He thought she probably meant 2.5 gallons. So he knocked on the door to clarify the point. The blonde came to the door and the milkman said, +ACIAIg-I found your note asking me to leave 25 gallons of milk. Did you mean 2.5 gallons?+ACIAIg- The blonde said, +ACIAIg-I want 25 gallons. I'm going to fill my bathtub up with milk and take a milk bath so I can look young and beautiful again.+ACIAIg- The milkman asked, +ACIAIg-Do you want it pasteurized?+ACIAIg- The blonde said, +ACIAIg-No, just up to my boobs.

+ACI-Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.' Ralph and Edna were both patients in a mental hospital. One day while they were walking past the hospital swimming pool, Ralph suddenly jumped into the deep end. He sank to the bottom of the pool and stayed there. Edna promptly jumped in to save him. She swam to the bottom and pulled him out. When the Head Nurse Director became aware of Edna's heroic act she immediately ordered her to be discharged from the hospital, as she now considered her to be mentally stable. When she went to tell Edna the news she said, 'Edna, I have good news and bad news. The good news is you're being discharged, since you were able to rationally respond to a crisis by jumping in and saving the life of the person you love... I have concluded that your act displays sound+AC0-mindedness. The bad news is, Ralph hung himself in the bathroom with his bathrobe belt right after you saved him. I am so sorry, but he's dead.' Edna replied, 'He didn't hang himself, I put him there to dry... How soon can I go home?'+ACI-

He hands the Indian a five dollar bill and says, +ACIAIg-do your stuff+ACIAIg- The Indian looks and looks, up and down, and appears to be befuddled. The young man is now thinking he's gone one up on the Indian. The Indian says, +ACIAIg-You're from Arkansas+ACIAIg- The young man gets really upset and can't for the life of him figure out how the Indian could know that, so he asks, +ACIAIg-How in the world did you know I'm from Arkansas?+ACIAIg- The Indian replies, +ACIAIg-by the wool on your zipper.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-For a couple years I've been blaming it on lack of sleep and too much partying, but now I found out the real reason: I'm tired because I'm overworked. The population of this country is 237 million. 104 million are retired. That leaves 133 million to do the work. There are 85 million in school, which leaves 48 million to do the work. Of this there are 29 million employed by the federal government, leaving 19 million to do the work. 2.8 million are in the Armed Forces, which leaves 16.2 million to do the work. Take from the total the 14,800,000 people who work for State and City Government and that leaves 1.4 million to do the work. At any given time there are 188,000 people in hospitals, leaving 1,212,000 to do the work. Now, there are 1,211,998 people in prisons. That leaves just two people to do the work. You and me.

The new guy looked up at the vaulted ceiling which was eaily 30 feet above and was convince he would soon win his money back and a nights worth of drinking.

The drunk muttered in response, 'Well, I'll be damned,' then returned to his paper. The priest, thinking about what he had said, nudged the man and apologized. 'I'm very sorry. I didn't mean to come on so strong. How long have you had arthritis? The drunk answered, 'I don't have it, Father. I was just reading here that the Pope does.+ACI-

+ACI-If you had bought +ACQ-1000.00 of Nortel stock one year ago, it would now be worth +ACQ-49.00. With Enron, you would have +ACQ-16.50 left of the original +ACQ-1,000.00. With Worldcom, you would have less than +ACQ-5.00 left.

Just you go ahead and finish your meal, Sonny+ACEAIgAi- For lunch the old man made hamburgers. Again, John was concerned about the plates as his appeared to have tiny specks around the edge that looked like dried egg and asked, +ACIAIg-Are you sure these plates are clean?+ACIAIg- Without looking up the old man said, +ACIAIg-I told you before, Sonny, those dishes are as clean as cold water can get them. Now don't you fret, I don't want to hear another word about it+ACEAIgAi- Later that afternoon, John was on his way to a nearby town and as he was leaving, his grandfather's dog started to growl, and wouldn't let him pass. John yelled and said, +ACIAIg-Grandfather, your dog won't let me get to my car+ACIAIg-.

+ACI-TWO DUCK HUNTERS FROM WISCONSIN: ABSOLUTELY A TRUE STORY HEARD ON A WISCONSIN RADIO STATION REPORTING ON THE INCIDENT. A guy buys a new Lincoln Navigator for +ACQ-42,500.00 (with monthly payments of +ACQ-560.00). He and a friend go duck hunting in upper Wisconsin It's mid+AC0-winter+ADs- and of course all of the lakes are frozen. These two guys go out on the ice with their GUNS, a DOG, and of course the new NAVIGATOR. They decide they want to make a natural+AC0-looking open water for the ducks to focus on, something for the decoys to float in. Now making a hole in the ice large enough to invite a passing duck, is going to take a little more power than the average drill auger can produce. So, out of the back of the new Navigator comes a stick of dynamite with a short 40 second+AC0-fuse. Now our two Rocket Scientists, afraid they might slip on the ice while trying to run away after lighting the fuse (and becoming toast, along with the Navigator), decide on the following course of action: They light the 40 second fuse+ADs- then, with a mighty thrust, they throw the stick of dynamite as far away as possible. Remember a couple of paragraphs back when I mentioned the NAVIGATOR, the GUNS, and the DOG...??? Let's talk about the dog: A highly trained Black Lab used for RETRIEVING+ADs- especially things thrown by the owner. You guessed it: The dog takes off across the ice at a high rate of speed and grabs the stick of dynamite, with the burning 40+AC0-second fuse, just as it hits the ice. The two men swallow, blink, start waving their arms and, with veins in their necks swelling to resemble stalks of rhubarb scream and holler at the dog to stop. The dog, now apparently cheered on by his Master, keeps coming. One hunter panics, grabs the shotgun and shoots the dog. The shotgun is loaded with +ACM-8 bird shot, hardly big enough to stop a Black Lab. The dog stops for a moment, slightly confused, then continues on. Another shot, and this time the dog, still standing, becomes really confused and of course terrified, thinks these two geniuses have gone insane. The dog takes off to find cover, UNDER the brand new Navigator. The men continue to scream as they run. The red hot exhaust pipe on the truck touches the dog's rear end, he yelps, drops the dynamite under the truck and takes off after his master. Then +ACIAIg- BOOOOOOOOM.... The truck is blown to bits and sinks to the bottom of the lake, leaving the two idiots standing there with +ACIAIg-I can't believe this just happened+ACIAIg- looks on their faces. The insurance company says that sinking a vehicle in a lake by illegal use of explosives is NOT COVERED by the policy. And he still had yet to make the first of those +ACQ-560.00 a month payments. The dog is okay. . .doing fine. And you thought Rednecks only live in the South.........+ACI-

Why?+ACIAIg- The cowboy looked at the Lone Ranger and said, +ACIAIg-I just thought you would like to know that your horse is just about dead outside.+ACIAIg- The Lone Ranger and Tonto rushed outside and sure enough, Silver was about dead from heat exhaustion. The Lone Ranger got him some water and made him drink it. Soon Silver was starting to feel better. The Lone Ranger turned to Tonto and said, +ACIAIg-Tonto, I want you to run around Silver and see if you can create enough of a breeze to make him start to feel better.+ACIAIg- Tonto said, +ACIAIg-Sure, Kemosabe+ACIAIg-, and took off running circles around Silver. Not able to do anything but wait, the Lone Ranger returned to the bar to finish his drink. A few minutes later, another cowboy struts into the bar and announces, +ACIAIg-Who owns that big white horse outside?+ACIAIg- The Lone Ranger stands again and claims, +ACIAIg-I do. What is wrong with him this time?+ACIAIg- The cowboy says to him, +ACIAIg-Nothin' much, I just wanted you to know....you left your Injun running.+ACI-

When the grieving widow checked her email, she took one look at the monitor, let out a piercing scream, and fell to the floor in a dead faint. At the sound, her family rushed into the room and saw this note on the screen: Dearest Wife, Just got checked in. Everything prepared for your arrival tomorrow. P.S. Sure is hot down here.+ACI-

+ACI-A woman desperately looking for work went into a factory. The personnel manager looked over her resume and regretfully explained to her that he had nothing worthy of her talents. The woman answered that she really needed work and would take almost anything. The personnel manager hemmed and hawed and finally said that he did have a low+AC0-skill job on the Tickle Me Elmo line, but nothing else. The woman happily accepted his offer. He took her down to the line, explained her duties, and told her to report at 8:00 AM the next day. The next day at 8:45 there was a knock at the personnel manager's door. The Tickle Me Elmo line manager came in and started ranting about the woman who had just been hired. After listening to how badly backed up the assembly line was, the personnel manager suggested that the line manager show him the problem. Together they went down to the line and, sure enough, Elmos were backed up from here to kingdom come. Right at the end of the line was the woman who had just been hired. She had pulled over a roll of the material used for the Elmos, and had a big bag of marbles. They both watched as she cut a little piece of fabric, took two marbles, and started sewing them between Elmo's legs. The personnel manager started laughing uncontrollably. Finally, he pulled himself together, walked over to the new employee, and said, +ACIAIg-I'm sorry. I guess you misunderstood me yesterday. What I wanted you to do was give Elmo two test tickles.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

One day, when Billy went down tothe bus stop to meet the bus to go to school, he found all of his friendshuddled around in a little group, talking about the Purple Wombat.Being a little boy, Billy was curious. So he asked them,+ACIAIg-What's the Purple Wombat?+ACIAIgAiACI-You don't know what the Purple Wombat is?+ACIAIg- the children exclaimeddisgustedly. For the rest of the morning, they would not go near Billy,always standing far away and staring at him. Then the bus came. Billy,confused, got on the bus along with the rest of the children.+ACIAIg-Hey, Mister Bus Driver+ACEAIgAi- one of the chldren shouted. +ACIAIg-Billy doesn't knowwhat the Purple Wombat is+ACEAIgAi-The bus driver turned around abruptly. +ACIAIg-You don't know what the PurpleWombat is?+ACIAIg- he said in disbelief. He ordered Billy to sit in thevery back of the bus, all by himself.Eventually, they got to school, and Billy got off the bus and went toclass. Class proceeded normally+ADs- the students did the pledge of allegianceand worked on their multiplication tables for a while. Then theteacher led them into a unit on geography. Billy was not really payingattention, but he heard the teacher mention something about the PurpleWombat.Billy's hand shot up, and, when the teacher called on him, Billy asked,+ACIAIg-Teacher, what's the Purple Wombat?+ACIAIgAiACI-You don't know what the Purple Wombat is?+ACIAIg- the teacher cried in alarm,+ACIAIg-Get yourself to the principal's office right now, young man. No, no buts +AC0ALQ-march+ACEAIgAi-So Billy headed down the long, dark, frightening hallway to theprincipal's office. He slowly opened the large, heavy door, andtimidly entered the room behind it. There, at a large, imposing desk, satthe principal. The principal was a hulking man, balding, with a thinmustache. He spoke in a deep baritone voice. He was enough tofrighten little boys like Billy who had been sent to his office almost totears.+ACIAIg-Well, Billy,+ACIAIg- he began slowly. +ACIAIg-What seems to be the problem?+ACIAIgAiACI-Mr. Principal, I just don't know what's going on today. Everyone's beenacting weird, and they're all treating me really badly. Like teacher justsent me to you and stuff.+ACIAIgAiACI-Now, Billy, I'm here to help you. I'm the princi+AC0-Pal, after all.Heh heh. Can you tell me why everyone's acting so strangely?+ACIAIgAiACI-It's because I don't know what some stupid Purple Wombat is.+ACIAIgAiACI-What? You don't know what the Purple Wombat is? That's it. I am callingyour mother, young man. Consider yourself suspended.+ACIAIg-The principal threw Billy out of his office and told him to go home.Billy, crying, began the long walk home. When he got there, his mother wasstanding in the doorway waiting for him.+ACIAIg-Billy+ACEAIgAi- she called, sobbing, +ACIAIg-I was so worried about you+ACE- What happened?+ACIAIgAiACI-Mom,+ACIAIg- Billy cried, +ACIAIg-Everyone was being mean to me and I had to sit in theback of the bus all by myself and the teacher sent me to the principal'soffice and the principal suspended me, all because I don't know what thePurple Wombat is+ACEAIgAiACIAIg-What? You don't know what the Purple Wombat is?+ACIAIg- Billy's mother shrieked.+ACIAIg-Go to your room this minute. Go+ACE- Just wait until your father gets home+ACEAIgAi-So Billy marched up the stairs and into his room. He collapsed on the bed,crying. After some amount of time, he heard a car pull in and some doorsshutting. His father was home. He could hear his parents talkingdownstairs but didn't know what they were saying. Then he heard footstepscoming up the stairs, and his door opened.+ACIAIg-Billy,+ACIAIg- his father began in that lecturing+AC0-father tone, +ACIAIg-Your mother saysyou've been acting badly lately. Would you like to tell me what you've done?+ACIAIgAiACI-Dad, I haven't done anything+ACE- I just don't know what the Purple Wombat is+ACEAIgAiACIAIg-You...don't know what the Purple Wombat is. Well, in that case, you canjust stay in this room all night, mister. And forget about dinner+ACEAIgAi-Billy's father slammed the door and stormed off. Billy collapsed on hisbed, crying his eyes out. He spent the next several hours that way +AC0ALQ- lyingthere, crying, wishing he would wake up.Then, in the middle of the night, he heard a voice. It said:+ACIAIg-Billy. I am the Purple Wombat, Billy.+ACIAIg-Billy sat up with a start. He looked around the room, trying to find thesource of the voice, but he could not.+ACIAIg-Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Find me, Billy.+ACIAIg-It was coming from out the window. So Billy got up, put his shoes on,opened the window, and climbed out on to the roof.+ACIAIg-Billy. I am the Purple Wombat.+ACIAIg-Billy jumped down off the roof and followed the voice down the road. He gotto the edge of a wood.+ACIAIg-Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Follow me, Billy.+ACIAIg-The voice was coming from inside the wood. It was very dark and veryfrightening, but Billy didn't care. He had to find out what the PurpleWombat was. So, bravely, he entered the wood.+ACIAIg-Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Keep going, Billy.+ACIAIg-Billy kept going into the wood. He could hardly see anything, and he keptfalling down and walking into things and hurting himself. But he kept going,driven by a need to find this enigma that kept calling his name.+ACIAIg-Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. This way, Billy.+ACIAIg-Eventually, Billy emerged from the wood. He was on the shore of the townlake.+ACIAIg-Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. I'm out here, Billy.+ACIAIg-It was coming from out across the lake. Billy got one of the small rowboatsfrom the dock, untied it, and rowed out. Since he was only a small boy, itwas very difficult. But he had to find out what the Purple Wombat was.+ACIAIg-Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Row, Billy.+ACIAIg-The voice was coming from across the lake. Billy doubled his effort, andthe boat began to move a little faster. When he was about half way acrossthe lake, he heard: +ACIAIg-Billy, I am the Purple Wombat. I'm up here, Billy.+ACIAIg-It was coming from directly above him. Billy stopped rowing and stood upto look for it. The boat tipped over, dumping him in the lake. Billy didn'tknow how to swim, so he drowned.Moral: Don't stand up in a boat.+ACI-

+ACI-One day, a man had an accident at work, which resulted in him getting his eye gouged out. He was rushed to hospital, and, after awaking from an emergency operation, was told by the doctor that he'd been given a glass eye. The man looked in the mirror to see the result, and was shocked to see that, whereas his original eye colour was blue, his new glass eye was brown. The man was outraged. ''I can't walk around like this+ACEAIQAiACI- +ACIAIg-Sir,+ACIAIg- the doctor said, +ACIAIg-there is a severe shortage on blue eyes. We had to give you a brown one. If somehow you can get hold of a blue eye, and bring it here to the hospital, we will happily fit it for you.'' A few weeks later, the man was driving home from work late one night during a big storm. Suddenly, the car in front of him lost control and skidded off the road before finally hitting a tree. The man screeched to a halt, and ran down the embankment to see if he could help. He found the driver of the car sprawled out over the wreckage, dead as a doornail...with a blue glass eye+ACE- As it was so late at night and during such a big storm, noone was about. So the man proceeded to get a screwdriver and removed one of the deceased man's blue eyes, replacing it with his brown glass eye. He raced down to the local hospital to have the replacement blue eye fitted. A few days later, the man was driving along the same stretch of road when he saw the police examining the crash scene and towing the car wreck away. Concerned to find out if the police were on to him, the man decided to go over to try and see if the police had any leads. +ACIAIg-Excuse me, sir,+ACIAIg- said the policeman. +ACIAIg-Do you know anything about this at all?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No, constable+ACIAIg-, said the man. +ACIAIg-Well, we can't figure this out.

Three weeks went by and finally the old woman got a fax from the ship. It read: +ACIAIg-Ma'am, sorry to inform you, we found your husband dead at the bottom of the ocean.

+ACI-One Christmas Eve, a frenzied young man ran into a pet shop looking for an unusual Christmas gift for his wife. The shop owner suggested a parrot, named Chet, which could sing famous Christmas carols. This seemed like the perfect gift. +ACIAIg-How do I get him to sing?+ACIAIg- The young man asked, excitedly. +ACIAIg-Simply hold a lighted match directly under his feet.+ACIAIg- was the shop owner's reply. The shop owner held a lighted match under the parrot's left foot. Chet began to sing: +ACIAIg-Jingle Bells+ACE- Jingle Bells+ACE- ...+ACIAIg- The shop owner then held another match under the parrot's right foot. Then Chet's tune changed, and the air was filled with: +ACIAIg- Silent Night, Holy Night...+ACIAIg- The young man was so impressed that he paid the shop+AC0-keeper and ran home as quickly as he could with Chet under his arm. When the wife saw her gift she was overwhelmed. +ACIAIg-How beautiful+ACEAIgAi- She exclaimed, +ACIAIg-Can he talk?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No,+ACIAIg- the young man replied, +ACIAIg-But he can sing. Let me show you.+ACIAIg- So the young man whipped out his lighter and placed it under Chet's left foot, as the shop+AC0-keeper had shown him, and Chet crooned: +ACIAIg-Jingle Bells+ACE- Jingle bells+ACE-...+ACIAIg- The man then moved the lighter to Chet's right foot, and out came: +ACIAIg-Silent Night, Holy night...+ACIAIg- The wife, her face filled with curiosity, then asked, +ACIAIg-What if we hold the lighter between his legs?+ACIAIg- The man did not know. +ACIAIg-Let's try it,+ACIAIg- he answered, eager to please his wife. So they held the lighter between Chet's legs. Chet twisted his face, cleared his throat, and the little parrot sang out loudly like it was the performance of his life: +ACIAIg-Chet's nuts roasting on an open fire....+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-Once upon a time, in a far+AC0-off land, there was an ice cream truck driver named Bob. Everyone in the neighborhood knew when Bob's truck was driving by because of the giant inflatable clown head that he'd strapped to the roof. The clown head had speakers in it, and as Bob drove by he would talk into a little microphone, saying things like, +ACIAIg-Hey, kids, buy ice cream+ACEAIgAi- And lo and behold, it sounded just like the giant inflatable clown head itself was talking. Bob liked his job because he got to make kids happy and eat a lot of ice cream himself. And so it went, for many years. Until one day, the government of the far+AC0-off land decided to outlaw ice cream. Yes, all of a sudden, the treats that Bob once sold had become controlled substances. Bob, fearing for his job, quickly converted his ice cream truck into a tuna+AC0-fish truck, but he kept the clown head and the speakers for old times' sake. But instead of turning in his stocks of ice cream to the government, he kept them in the basement of his house, and every day he would take out a popsicle or a sundae cone and eat it in the privacy of his home. It got so Bob would eat more and more ice cream every day, which made him a bit of a jumpier person than he had been before, but nobody seemed to mind. And so it happened that one day, Bob was rather erratically driving his tuna+AC0-fish truck around the neighborhood, having just eaten two pudding pops and an orange creamsicle. He picked up his microphone, as he had done so many times before, but when he switched the microphone on, the sugar buzz kicked in, and all he could say was: +ACIAIg-T'nnufidgeiss ver'gyood+ACE- Buy'tnaow+ACEAIgAi- And that's when Bob realized that he had a problem. A problem...with truck head diction.+ACI-
+ACI-These four friends were so confident that the weekend before finals, they decided to go up to Dallas and party with some friends up there. They had a great time. However, after all the partying, they slept all day Sunday and didn't make it back to Austin until early Monday morning. Rather than taking the final then, they decided to find their professor after the final and explain to him why they missed it. They explained that they had gone to Dallas for the weekend with the plan to come back and study but, unfortunately, they had a flat tire on the way back, didn't have a spare, and couldn't get help for a long time. As a result, they missed the final. The Professor thought it over and then agreed they could make up the final the following day. The guys were elated and relieved. They studied that night and went in the next day at the time the professor had told them. He placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet, and told them to begin. They looked at the first problem, worth 5 points. It was something simple about free radical formation. +ACIAIg-Cool,+ACIAIg- they thought at the same time, each one in his separate room. +ACIAIg-This is going to be easy.+ACIAIg- Each finished the problem and then turned the page.

+ACI-A contestant on +ACIAIg-Who Wants to be a Millionaire+ACIAIg- had reached the final plateau. If she answered the next question correctly, she would win+ACQ-1,000,000. If she answered incorrectly, she would pocket only the +ACQ-32,000 milestone money. As she suspected it would be, the million+AC0- dollar question was no pushover. It was: Which of the following species of birds does not build its own nest, but instead lays its eggs in the nests of other birds? Is it A) the condor+ADs- B) the buzzard+ADs- C) the cuckoo+ADs- or D) the vulture?+ACIAIg- The woman was on the spot. She did not know the answer. And she was doubly on the spot because she had used up her 50/50 Lifeline and her Audience Poll Lifeline. All that remained was her Phone+AC0-a+AC0-Friend Lifeline, and the woman had hoped against hope that she would not have to use it because the only friend that she knew would be home happened to be a blonde.

The answer is C: The cuckoo.+ACIAIg- The contestant had to make a decision and make it fast. She considered employing a reverse strategy and giving Regis any answer except the one that her friend had given her. And considering that her friend was a blonde, it would seem to be the logicalthing to do. On the other hand +AC0ALQ- the blonde had responded with such confidence, such certitude, that the contestant could not help but be persuaded. +ACIAIg-I need an answer,+ACIAIg- said Regis. Crossing her fingers, the contestant said, +ACIAIg-C: The cuckoo.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Is that your final answer?+ACIAIg- asked Regis. +ACIAIg-Yes, that is my final answer.+ACIAIg- Two seconds later, Regis said, +ACIAIg-I regret to inform you that the answer is+AC0-...... absolutely correct. You are now a millionaire+ACEAIgAi- Three days later, the contestant hosted a party for her family and friends including the blonde who had helped her win the million dollars. +ACIAIg-Jenny, I just do not know how to thank you,+ACIAIg- said the contestant. +ACIAIg-Because of your knowing the answer to that final question, I am now a millionaire. And do you want to know something? It was your assuredness with which you answered the question that convinced me to go with your choice. By the way......how did you happen to know the right answer?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Oh, come on+ACEAIgAi- said the blonde. +ACIAIg-Everybody knows that cuckoos don't build nests.

Everyone started screaming and running for the back entrance, trampling each other in a frantic effort to get away from evil incarnate. Soon the church was empty except for one elderly gentleman who sat calmly in his pew without moving, seemingly oblivious to the fact that God's ultimate enemy was in his presence. So Satan walked up to the man and said, 'Do you know who I am?' The man replied, 'Yep, sure do.' 'Aren't you afraid of me?' Satan asked. 'Nope, sure ain't.' said the man. Don't you realize I can kill you with one word?' asked Satan. 'Don't doubt it for a minute, ' returned the old man, in an even tone. 'Did you know that I can cause you profound, horrifying agony for all eternity?' persisted Satan. 'Yep,' was the calm reply. 'And you're still not afraid?' asked Satan. 'Nope,' said the old man. More than a little perturbed, Satan asked, ' Why aren't you afraid of me?' The man calmly replied, 'Been married to your sister for 48 years.'+ACI-

+ACI-History began some 12,000 years ago.(Actually, it was 40,000 years ago.) Humans existed as members of small bands of nomadic hunter/gatherers. They lived on deer in the mountains during the summer and would go to the coast and live on fish and lobster in winter. The two most important events in all of history were the invention of beer and the invention of the wheel. The wheel was invented to get man to the beer. These were the foundations of modern civilization and, together, were the catalyst for the splitting of humanity into two distinct subgroups: Liberals and Conservatives. Once beer was discovered, it required grain and that was the beginning of agriculture. Neither the glass bottle nor aluminum can was invented yet, so while our early human ancestors were sitting around waiting for them to be invented, they just stayed close to the brewery. That's how villages were formed. Some men spent their days tracking and killing animals to barbeque at night while they were drinking beer. This was the beginning of what is known as +ACIAIg-the Conservative movement.+ACIAIg- Other men who were weaker and less skilled at hunting learned to live off the Conservatives by showing up for the nightly barbeques and doing the sewing, fetching and hair dressing. This was the beginning of the Liberal movement. Some of these liberal men eventually evolved into women. The rest became known as girlymen. Some noteworthy liberal achievements include the domestication of cats, the invention of group therapy, group hugs and the concept of Democratic voting to decide how to divide the meat and beer that Conservatives provided. Over the years, Conservatives came to be symbolized by the largest, most powerful land animal on earth, the elephant. Liberals are symbolized by the jackass. Modern Liberals like imported beer (with lime added)(+ACY- foo foo coffee), but most prefer white wine or imported, bottled water. They eat raw fish but like their beef well done. Sushi, tofu, and French food are standard Liberal fare. Another interesting evolutionary side note: Most of their women have higher testosterone levels than their men. Most social workers, personal injury attorneys, journalists, dreamers in Hollywood and group therapists are Liberals. Liberals invented the designated hitter rule because it wasn't +ACIAIg-fair+ACIAIg- to make the pitcher also bat. Conservatives drink domestic beer. They eat red meat and still provide for their women. Conservatives are big+AC0-game hunters, rodeo cowboys, lumberjacks, construction workers, firemen, medical doctors, police officers, corporate executives, fighter pilots, athletes and generally anyone who works productively outside government. Conservatives who own companies hire other Conservatives who want to work for a living. Liberals produce little or nothing. They like to +ACIAIg-govern+ACIAIg- the producers and decide what to do with the production. Liberals believe Europeans are more enlightened than Americans. That is why most of the Liberals remained in Europe when Conservatives were coming to America. They crept in after the Wild West was tame and created a business of trying to get MORE for nothing. Here ends today's lesson in world history. It should be noted that a Liberal will have an uncontrollable urge to respond to the above instead of simply laughing and deleting or forwarding it.+ACI-

+ACI-Herbert A. Millington Chair +AC0- Search Committee 412A Clarkson Hall, Whitson University College Hill, MA 34109 Dear Professor Millington, Thank you for your letter of March 16. After careful consideration, I regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your refusal to offer me an assistant professor position in your department. This year I have been particularly fortunate in receiving an unusually large number of rejection letters. With such a varied and promising field of candidates, it is impossible for me to accept all refusals. Despite Whitson's outstanding qualifications and previous experience in rejecting applicants, I find that your rejection does not meet my needs at this time. Therefore, I will assume the position of assistant professor in your department this August. I look forward to seeing you then. Best of luck in rejecting future applicants. Sincerely, Chris L. Jensen+ACI-
