For all of you with teenagers or who have had  teenagers or are a teenager you may want to know why they really have a lot in common with cats:  +AC0- Neither teenagers nor cats turn their heads when you call them by name.  +AC0- No matter what you do for them it is not enough. Indeed all humane efforts are barely adequate to compensate for the privilege of waiting on them hand and foot.  +AC0- You rarely see a cat walking outside of the house with an adult human being and it can be safely said that no teenager in his or her right mind wants to be seen in public with his or her parents.  +AC0- Even if you tell jokes as well as Jay Leno neither your cat nor your teen will ever crack a smile.  +AC0- No cat or teenager shares you taste in music.  +AC0- Cats and teenagers can lie on the living+AC0-room sofa for hours on end without moving barely breathing.  +AC0- Cats have nine lives. Teenagers carry o n as if they did. +AC0- Cats and teenagers yawn in exactly the same manner communicating that ultimate human ecstasy +AC0ALQ- a sense of complete and utter boredom.  +AC0- Cats and teenagers do not improve anyone's furniture.  +AC0- Cats that are free to roam outside sometimes have been known to return in the middle of the night to deposit a dead animal in your bedroom. Teenagers are not above that sort of behavior.  Thus if you must raise teenagers the best sources of advice are not other parents but veterinarians. It is also a good idea to keep a guidebook on cats at hand at all times. And remember above all else put out the food and do not make any sudden moves in their direction. When they make up their minds they will finally come to you for some affection and comfort and it will be a triumphant moment for all concerned.

+ACI-There once was an accountant who lived her whole life without ever taking advantage of any of the people she worked for. In fact she made sure that every job she did resulted in a win+AC0-win situation. One day while walking down the street she was tragically hit by a bus and she died. Her soul arrived up in heaven where she was met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself. +ACIAIg-Welcome to Heaven+ACIAIg- said St. Peter. +ACIAIg-Before you get settled in though it seems we have a problem. You see strangely enough we've never once had an accountant make it this far and we're not really sure what  to do with you.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No problem just let me in.+ACIAIg- said the accountant. +ACIAIg-Well I'd like to but I have higher orders. What we're going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in .+ACIAIg-  +ACIAIg-Actually I think I've made up my mind...I prefer to stay in Heaven+ACIAIg-  +ACIAIg-Sorry we have rules...+ACIAIg- And with that St. Peter put the accountant in an elevator and it went  down+AC0-down+AC0-down to hell. The doors opened and the accountant found herself stepping out onto the putting green of a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club and standing in front of her were all her  friends +AC0- fellow accountants that she had worked with and they were all dressed in evening gowns and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks and they talked about old  times. They played an excellent round of golf and at night went to the country club where she enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil who was actually a really nice guy (kinda cute) and she had a great time telling jokes and dancing. The accountant was having such a good time that before she knew it it was ti me to leave. Everybody shook her hand and waved goodbye as she got on the elevator. The elevator went up+AC0-up+AC0-up and opened back up at the Pearly Gates and found St. Peter waiting for her. +ACIAIg-Now it's time to spend a day in heaven.+ACIAIg- So the accountant spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and singing. She had a great time and before she knew it her 24 hours were up and St. Peter came and got her. +ACIAIg-So you've spent a day in hell and you've spent a day in heaven. Now you must choose your eternity.+ACIAIg-  The accountant paused for a second and then replied +ACIAIg-Well I never thought I'd say this I mean Heaven has been really great and all but I think I had a better time in Hell.+ACIAIg- So St. Peter escorted her to the elevator and again the accountant went  down+AC0-down+AC0-down back to Hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in  garbage and filth. She saw her friends were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks.  The Devil came up to her and put his arm around her. +ACIAIg-I don't understand+ACIAIg- stammered the accountant +ACIAIg-Yesterday I was here and there was a  golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and we danced and had  a great time. Now all there is is a wasteland of garbage and all my  friends look miserable.+ACIAIg-  The Devil looked at her and smiled. +ACIAIg-That's because yesterday you were a recruit but today you're staff.+ACIAIg-  +AC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQAtAC0ALQ- An accountant applies for the position of Chief Financial Officer.

To counteract this we tie strings to our penises.+ACIAIg- The customer looked confused. +ACIAIg-How does that help?+ACIAIg- he asked. +ACIAIg-Well when I go to the bathroom I just use the string. Since I never touched myself I don't need to wash my hands.+ACIAIg- The customer nodded and asked +ACIAIg-But how do you get it back in your pants?+ACIAIg- The flight attendant smiled +ACIAIg-I don't know about the other guys but I use the spoon.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-A young lady was conducting a study in to human sexual behavior. She came to the conclusion that the best place to find participants for the survey would be the airport. After three hours of questioning passengers she sees a pilot walking to his gate. Having heard of the reputation of pilots she stops him +ACIAIg-Excuse me Captain+ACIAIg- she says +ACIAIg-I am doing a survey on human  sexuality...I was wondering if you could answer a few questions...+ACIAIg-  The pilot agrees and the young lady starts questioning him.

+ACI-The Captain was Jewish and the new First Officer was Chinese. It was the first time they had flown together and it was obvious by the silence that they didn't get along. After 30 minutes the Captain finally spoke. He said +ACIAIg- I don't like Chinese. +ACIAIg- The F.O. replied +ACIAIg- Ooooh no like Chinese? Why is that? +ACIAIg-  The Captain said +ACIAIg- You bombed Pearl Harbor. That's why I don't like Chinese. +ACIAIg- The F.O. said +ACIAIg- Nooooo noooo ... Chinese not bomb Pearl Harbah.

The Captain tried to correct him +ACIAIg- No no. The Jews didn't sink the Titanic. It  was an iceberg. +ACIAIg- +ACIAIg- Iceberg Goldberg Rosenberg .. no mattah .. all same +ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-An employee of USAir with the last name of Gay boarded a USAir flight with a free travel voucher. Soon after he sat down someone else came and claimed he had the same seat assignment so Mr. Gay moved down do an empty seat. Soon after that the airplane began to fill up. The rule with the USAir employee vouchers is that if a paying customer needs your seat you have to surrender it. So when the flight became completely full and still  more needed to get on a flight attendant went to the original seat of Mr. Gay and said the man now sitting there +ACIAIg-Excuse me are you Gay?''

During the heat of the space race in the 1960's the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration decided it needed a ballpoint pen to write in the zero gravity confines of its space capsules. After considerable research and development the Astronaut Pen was developed at a cost of about +ACQ-1 million U.S. The pen worked and also enjoyed some modest success as a novelty item back here on Earth. The Soviet Union faced with the same problem used a pencil.
+ACI-Southwest Airlines makes humor a high  priority. Here are some actual humorous statements by airline flight crews:  +ACIAIg-Good morning. As we leave Dallas it+AGA-s warm the sun is shining and the birds are singing. We are going to Charlotte where it+AGA-s dark windy and raining.

She had just finished saying 'In the event of a water landing your seat cushion may be used as a flotation device' when a man remarked +ACIAIg-Hey+ACE- If the plane can't fly why should I believe the seat can float?+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-At one of the packed Delta ticket counters all of ticket agents were doing their best to politely process each passenger as quickly as they could. A man toward the end of the snaking line of passengers was obviously impatient and very frustrated at having to wait so long in the slow moving line. He finally decided to march right up to the counter pulling his wheeled suitcase and demanded that he be given his boarding pass. The ticket agent turned looked at him blinked took a shallow deep breath and said +ACIAIg-Sir as you can see there are many passengers ahead of you. We are doing our best to process the passengers as fast as we  can. I'm afraid you'll have to get back in line+ACIAIg-.

So the boy asked the stewardess +ACIAIg-If big dogs have baby dogs and big cats have baby cats why don't big planes have baby planes?+ACIAIg- The stewardess asked +ACIAIg-Did your mother tell you to ask me?+ACIAIg- He said that his mother had.

+ACI-An airplane was losing altitude over the Rocky Mountains. The pilot over the intercom said that the entire luggage needed to be thrown overboard if they were to survive.  After all the luggage was thrown the plane was still going down so they asked for volunteers.

After they asked him he replied +ACIAIg-I bent over to get  the news paper this morning I farted and my whole house blew up+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-
No flight ever leaves on time unless you are running late and need the delay to make the flight. If you are running late for a flight it will depart from the farthest gate within the terminal. If you arrive very early for a flight it inevitably will be delayed. Flights never leave from Gate +ACM-1 at any terminal in the world. If you must work on your flight you will experience turbulence as soon as you touch pen to paper. Or start to drink your coffee. If you are assigned a middle seat you can determine who has the seats on the aisle and the window while you are still in the boarding area. Just look for the two largest passengers. Only passengers seated in window seats ever have to get up to go to the lavatory. The crying baby on board is always seated next to you. The best+AC0-looking woman/man on your flight is never seated next to you. The less carry+AC0-on luggag e space available on an aircraft the more carry+AC0-on luggage passengers will bring aboard.
+ACI-One day at a busy airport the passengers on a commercial airliner are seated waiting for the cockpit crew to show up so they can get underway.  The pilot and copilot finally appear in the rear of the plane and begin walking up to the cockpit through the center aisle.  Both appear to be blind.  The pilot is using a white cane bumping into passengers right and left as he stumbles down the aisle and the copilot is using a guide dog. Both have their eyes covered with huge sunglasses. At first the passengers do not react+ADs- thinking that it must be some sort of practical joke. However after a few minutes the engines start revving and the airplane starts moving down the runway. The passengers look at each other with some uneasiness whispering among themselves and looking desperately to the stewardesses for reassurance. Then the airplane starts accelerating rapidly and people  begin panicking. Some passengers are praying and as the plane gets closer and closer to the end of the runway the voices are becoming more and more hysterical.  Finally when the airplane has less than 20 feet of runway left there is a sudden change in the pitch of the shouts as everyone screams at once and at the very last moment the airplane lifts off and is airborne. Up in the cockpit the copilot breathes a sigh of relief and turns to the pilot: +ACIAIg-You know one of these days the passengers aren't going to scream and we're gonna get killed+ACE-+ACI-
+ACI-A plane was taking off from Kennedy Airport.  After it reached a comfortable cruising altitude the captain made an announcement over the intercom +ACIAIg-Ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking. Welcome to Flight Number 293 nonstop from New York to Los Angeles. The weather ahead is good and therefore we should have a smooth and uneventful flight. Now sit back and relax +AC0- OH MY GOD+ACEAIgAi- Silence. Then the captain came back on the intercom and said +ACIAIg-Ladies and Gentlemen I am so sorry if I scared you earlier but while I was talking the flight+AC0-attendant brought me a cup of coffee and spilled the hot coffee in my lap. You should see the front of my pants+ACEAIgAi- A passenger in Coach said +ACIAIg-That's nothing. You should see the back of mine+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-
+ACI-An award should go to the United Airlines gate agent in Denver for being smart and funny and making her point when confronted with a passenger who probably deserved to fly as cargo. During the final days at Denver's old Stapleton airport a crowded United flight was canceled. A single agent was rebooking a long line of inconvenienced travelers. Suddenly an angry passenger pushed his way to the desk. He slapped his ticket down on the counter and said +ACIAIg-I HAVE to be on this flight and it has to be FIRST CLASS.+ACIAIg- The agent replied +ACIAIg-I'm sorry sir. I'll be happy to try to help you but I've got to help these folks first and I'm sure we'll be able to work something out.+ACIAIg- The passenger was unimpressed. He asked loudly so that the passengers behind him could hear +ACIAIg-Do you have any idea who I am?+ACIAIg- Without hesitating the gate agent smiled and grabbed her public address microp hone. +ACIAIg-May I have your attention please?+ACIAIg- she began her voice bellowing throughout the terminal. +ACIAIg-We have a passenger here at the  gate WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHO HE IS. If anyone can help him find his  identity please come to gate 17.+ACIAIg- With the folks behind him in line laughing hysterically the man glared at the United agent gritted his teeth and swore +ACIAIg-F+AC0ALQAt- you.+ACIAIg- Without flinching she smiled and said +ACIAIg-I'm sorry sir but you'll have to stand in line for that too.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-A man named Mr. Smith was flying from San Francisco to LA. Unexpectedly the plane stopped in Sacramento along the way. The flight attendant explained that there would be a delay and if the passengers wanted to get off the aircraft the plane would re+AC0-board in 30 minutes. Everybody got off the plane except one gentleman who was blind. Mr. Smith had noticed him as he walked by and could tell the blind man had flown before because his Seeing Eye dog lay quietly underneath the seats in front of him throughout the entire flight.  Mr. Smith could also tell he had flown this very flight before because the pilot approached him and calling him by name said Keith we're in Sacramento for almost an hour. Would you like to get off and stretch your legs?+ACIAIg-  Keith replied +ACIAIg-No thanks but maybe the dog would like to stretch his legs+ACIAIg-.  Now picture this: All the people in the gate area came to  a complete quiet standstill when they looked up and saw the pilot walk off the plane with the Seeing Eye dog+ACE-  The pilot was even wearing sunglasses.  People scattered. They not only tried to change planes but they were trying to change airlines+ACE-+ACI-
+ACI-Fred and his wife Edna went to the state  fair every year. Every year Fred would say +ACIAIg-Edna I'd like to ride in  that there airplane.+ACIAIg- And every year Edna would say +ACIAIg-I know Fred but that airplane ride costs ten dollars and ten dollars is ten dollars.+ACIAIg-  One year Fred and Edna went to the fair and Fred said +ACIAIg-Edna I'm 71 years old. If I don't ride that airplane this year I may never get another chance.+ACIAIg- Edna replied +ACIAIg-Fred that there airplane ride costs ten dollars and ten dollars is ten dollars.+ACIAIg-  The pilot overheard them and said +ACIAIg-Folks I'll make you a deal. I'll take you both up for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not say one word I won't charge you but if you say one word it's ten dollars.+ACIAIg-  Fred and Edna agreed and up they go. The pilot does all kinds of twists and turns rolls and dives but not a word is heard. He does all his tricks over  again but still not a word.  They land and the pilot turns to Fred +ACIAIg-By golly I did everything could think of to get you to yell out but you didn't.+ACIAIg-  Fred replied +ACIAIg-Well I was gonna say something when Edna fell out but ten dollars is ten dollars.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-An airline pilot wrote that on this  particular flight he had hammered his ship into the runway really hard.  The airline had a policy which required the first officer to stand at  the door while the passengers exited give a smile and a +ACIAIg-Thanks for flying XYZ airline.+ACIAIg- He said that in light of his bad landing he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye thinking that someone would have a smart comment but no one seemed annoyed. Finally everyone had gotten off except for one little old lady walking  with a cane. She approached and asked conspiratorially +ACIAIg-Sonny mind if I ask you a question?+ACIAIg-  +ACIAIg-Why no Ma'am what is it?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Did we land or were we shot down?+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-A young and foolish pilot wanted to sound cool  on the aviation frequencies.

+ACI-A student was heading home for the holidays. When she got to the airline counter she presented her ticket to New York. As she gave the agent her luggage she made the remark +ACIAIg-I'd like you to send my green suitcase to Hawaii and my red suitcase to London.+ACIAIg- The confused agent said +ACIAIg-I'm sorry we can't do that.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Really??? I am so relieved to hear you say that because that's exactly what you did to my luggage last year+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-
+ACI-Brendan had spent a week visiting his family in Kentucky. His sister+AC0-in+AC0-law and seven+AC0-year+AC0-old nephew went with him when he returned to the airport. After verifying his seat number with the counter attendant Brendan walked back to his  relatives and stated that he'd have to wait an additional three hours in  the airport.  +ACIAIg-How come?+ACIAIg- his nephew asked. +ACIAIg-My plane has been grounded+ACIAIg- Brendan explained. +ACIAIg-Grounded?+ACIAIg- the little boy said. +ACIAIg-I didn't know planes had parents.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-Flying to Los Angeles from San Francisco the other day a passenger noticed that the +ACIAIg-Fasten Seat Belts+ACIAIg- sign was kept lit during the whole journey although the flight was a particularly smooth one. Just before landing he asked the stewardess about it. +ACIAIg-Well+ACIAIg- she explained +ACIAIg-up front there are 17 University of California girls going to Los Angeles for the weekend. +ACIAIg-In back there are 25 Coast Guard enlistees. What would you  do?+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-An airline pilot was scheduled to take a flight from New York to Los Angeles. The weather was too bad in New York to allow his usual on time departure. The weather in New York finally cleared and the pilot asked for his departure clearance. He was very dismayed to hear that he had another delay due to the increased traffic now leaving New York. Sometime later he finally received his clearance and decided he would try to make up the time lost by asking for a direct route to Los Angeles. Halfway across the country he was told to turn due South. Knowing that this turn would now throw him further behind schedule he inquired  quite agitated to the controller for the reason of the turn off course. The  controller replied that the turn was for noise abatement. The pilot was infuriated and said to the controller +ACIAIg-Look buddy I am  already way behind schedule with all the delays you guys have given me  today. I really don't see how I could be causing a noise problem for pedestrians when I am over 6 miles above the earth+ACEAIgAi- The controller answered in a calm voice +ACIAIg-Apparently Captain you  have never heard two 747's collide+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-
+ACI-Passengers on a Lufthansa flight heard this  announcement from the captain +ACIAIg-Ladies and Gentlemen I am sorry to  inform you that we have lost power to all of our engines and will shortly crash into the ocean.+ACIAIg- The passengers were obviously very worried about this situation but were somewhat comforted by the captain's next announcement. +ACIAIg-Ladies and Gentlemen we at Lufthansa have prepared for such an emergency and we would now like you to rearrange your seating so that all the non+AC0-swimmers are on the left side of the plane and all the swimmers are on the right side.+ACIAIg-  After this announcement all the passengers rearranged their seating to  comply with the captain's request. Two minutes later the captain made a belly landing in the ocean. The captain once again made an announcement +ACIAIg-Ladies and Gentlemen we have crashed into the ocean. All of the swimmers on the right side of the plane open you r emergency exits and quickly swim away from the plane. For all of the non+AC0-swimmers on the left side of plane... +ACIAIg-Thank You For Flying Lufthansa.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-The German controllers at Frankfurt Airport  were often short+AC0-tempered. They not only expected you to know your  parking location but how to get there without any assistance from them. So it was with some amusement that we (PanAm 747) listened to the following exchange between Frankfurt ground and a British Airways 747 (radio call Speedbird 206) after landing. Speedbird 206: +ACIAIg-Good morning Frankfurt Speedbird 206 clear of the active.+ACIAIg-  Ground: +ACIAIg-Guten morgan taxi to your gate.+ACIAIg- The British Airways 747 pulls onto the main taxiway and stops.

+ACI-An airplane pilot dies at the controls.  He goes to Hell. The devil takes him to the 'newly arrived' area.  There are three doors marked 1 2 and 3. The devil tells the pilot that he is going to get to choose his own hell but first the devil has to take care of something first and disappears. The curious pilot looks behind door number one. He sees a pilot going  through flight checks for all eternity. He looks behind door number two  and he sees a pilot that forever finds himself trying to resolve  emergency situations. He looks behind the last door and sees a Captain being waited on hand and foot by scantily+AC0-clad stewardesses. The devil returns just as the pilot gets back to his waiting position.  He offers the pilot a choice of door number one or two. The pilot says +ACIAIg-I wanted door number three+ACEAIgAi- +ACIAIg-Sorry+ACIAIg- replies the devil +ACIAIg-that's 'flight attendant's hell'.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
How does the captain know the aircraft is safely at the ramp? Both the engines and the co+AC0-pilot stop whining.

In my modern and carefully tested sytem an error is absolutely impossible absolutely impossible absolutely impossible ...+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-As the airliner was preparing to land in  Madrid in a rainstorm an English passenger seemed noticeably afraid.  +ACIAIg-What's the problem fellow?+ACIAIg- asked his seat mate. +ACIAIg-Surely+ACIAIg- said the Englishman +ACIAIg-you've heard the saying 'The planes in Spain fall mainly in the rains+ACEAIQ-'+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-While cruising at 40000 feet the airplane shuddered and Mr. Benson looked out the window. +ACIAIg-Good lord+ACEAIgAi- he screamed +ACIAIg-one of the engines just blew up+ACEAIgAi- Other passengers left their seats and came running over+ADs- suddenly the aircraft was rocked by a second blast as yet another engine exploded on the other side. The passengers were in a panic now and even the stewardesses couldn't maintain order. Just then standing tall and smiling confidently the pilot strode from the cockpit and assured everyone that there was nothing to worry about. His words and his demeanor seemed made most of the passengers feel better and they sat down as the pilot calmly walked to the door of the aircraft. There he grabbed several packages from under the seatsand began handing them to the flight attendants. Each crew member attatched the package to their backs. +ACIAIg-Say+ACIAIg- spoke up an alert passenger +ACIAIg-aren't tho se parachutes?+ACIAIg- The pilot said they were. The passenger went on +ACIAIg-But I thought you said there was nothing to worry about?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-There isn't+ACIAIg- replied the pilot as a third engine exploded.  +ACIAIg-We're going to get help.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

The pilot's hands were sweating the co+AC0-pilot was praying.

+ACI-One day at a busy airport the passengers on a commercial airliner are seated waiting for the pilot to show up so they can get under way. The pilot and copilot finally appear in the rear of the plane and begin walking up to the cockpit through the center aisle. Both appear to be blind+ADs- the pilot is using a white cane bumping into passengers right and left as he stumbles down the aisle. The copilot is using a guide dog.

After a few minutes though the engines start revving and the airplane begins moving down the runway. The passengers look at each other with some uneasiness. They start whispering among themselves and look desperately to the stewardesses for reassurance. Yet the plane starts accelerating rapidly and people begin panicking. So me passengers are praying and as the plane gets closer and closer to  the end of the runway the voices are becoming more and more  hysterical. When the plane has less than twenty feet of runway left there is a sudden change in the pitch of the shouts as everyone screams at once. At the very last moment the plane lifts off and is airborne. Up in the cockpit the copilot breathes a sigh of relief and tells the pilot: +ACIAIg-You know one of these days the passengers aren't going to scream and we aren't going to know when to take off+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

The aircraft was totally destroyed with only a burned hulk left smoldering in a tree line that bordered a farm. Secret Service descended upon the smoking hulk but could find no remains of the crew or the President's staff. To their amazement a lone farmer was plowing a field not too far away as if nothing at all happened. They hurried over to surround the man's tractor. +ACIAIg-Sir+ACIAIg- the senior Secret Service agent asked panting and out of breath. +ACIAIg-Did you see this terrible accident happen?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Yep. Sure did.+ACIAIg- The man muttered unconcernedly. +ACIAIg-Do you realize that is the President of the United States airplane?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Yep.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Were there any survivors?+ACIAIg- the agent gasped. +ACIAIg-Nope.

My hand is placed on my release ring for me and out I go with the dog.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-But how do you know when you are going to land?+ACIAIg- he was asked. +ACIAIg-I have a very keen sense of smell and I can smell the trees and grass when I am 300 feet from the ground+ACIAIg- he answered. +ACIAIg-But how do you know when to lift your legs for the final arrival on the ground?+ACIAIg- he was again asked.

+ACI-It was a few days before Christmas. The trip went reasonably well and he was ready to go back home. The airport on the other end had turned a tacky red and green and loudspeakers blared annoying elevator renditions of cherished Christmas carols.  Being someone who took Christmas very seriously and being slightly tired he was not in a particularly good mood. (Almost a scrooge) Going to check in his luggage (which for some reason had become one suitcase with entirely new clothes) he saw hanging mistletoe. Not real mistletoe but very cheap plastic with red paint on some of the rounder parts and green paint on some of the flatter and pointer parts that could be taken for mistletoe only in a very Picasso sort of way.  With a considerable degree of irritation and nowhere else to vent it he said to the attendant +ACIAIg-Even if we were married I would not want to kiss you under such a ghastly mo ckery of mistletoe.+ACIAIg-  +ACIAIg-Sir look more closely at where the mistletoe is.+ACIAIg-  +ACIAIg-Ok I see that it's above the luggage scale which is the place you'd have to step forward for a kiss.+ACIAIg-  +ACIAIg-That's not why it's there.+ACIAIg-  +ACIAIg-Ok I give up. Why is it there?+ACIAIg-  +ACIAIg-It's there so you can kiss your luggage good+AC0-bye.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-Aunt Bessie loved to visit her nieces and  nephews. However she had relatives all over the country. The problem was that no matter how much she enjoyed seeing them she  hated flying. No matter how safe people told her it was she was always  worried that someone would have a bomb on the plane.  She read books about how safe it was and listened to the stewardess  demonstrate all the safety features. But she still worried herself silly  every time a visit was coming up.  Finally the family decided that maybe if she saw the statistics she'd be convinced. So they sent her to a friend of the family who was an actuary.  +ACIAIg-Tell me+ACIAIg- she said suspiciously +ACIAIg-what are the chances that someone will have a bomb on a plane?+ACIAIg-  The actuary looked through his tables and said +ACIAIg-A very small chance. Maybe one in five hundred thousand.+ACIAIg-  She nodded then thought for a moment. +ACIAIg-So what are the o dds of two people having a bomb on the same plane?+ACIAIg-  Again he went through his tables.  +ACIAIg-Extremely remote+ACIAIg- he said. +ACIAIg-About one in a billion.+ACIAIg-  Aunt Bessie nodded and left his office.  And from that day on every time she flew she took a bomb with  her.+ACI-

+ACI-An airline captain was breaking in a very  pretty new blonde stewardess. The route they were flying had a stay+AC0-over in another city so upon their arrival the captain showed the stewardess the best place for airline personnel to eat shop and stay overnight. The next morning as the pilot was preparing the crew for the day's route he noticed the new stewardess was missing. He knew which room she was in at the hotel and called her up wondering what happened to her.

No matter what his frustrated  embarrassed mother does to try to calm him down the boy continues to scream furiously and kick the seats around him. Suddenly from the rear of the plane an elderly man in the uniform of an Air Force General is seen slowly walking forward up the aisle. Stopping the flustered mother with an upraised hand the white+AC0-haired courtly soft+AC0-spoken General leans down and motioning toward his chest  whispers something into the boy's ear. Instantly the boy calms down gently takes his mother's hand and quietly fastens his seat belt. All the other passengers burst into spontaneous applause. As the General slowly makes his way back to his seat one of the cabin attendants touches his sleeve. +ACIAIg-Excuse me General+ACIAIg- she ask s quietly +ACIAIg-but could I ask you what magic words you used on that little boy?+ACIAIg- The old man smiles serenely and gently confides +ACIAIg-I showed him my pilot's wings service stars and battle ribbons and explained that they entitle me to throw one passenger out the plane door on any flight I choose.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-McNally was taking his first plane ride flying over the Rocky Mountains.

+ACI-As a Delta Air Lines jet was flying over Arizona on a clear day the co+AC0-pilot was providing his passengers with a running commentary about landmarks over the PA system. +ACIAIg-Coming up on the right you can see the Meteor Crater which is a  major tourist attraction in northern Arizona. It was formed when a lump of  nickel and iron roughly 150 feet in diameter and weighing 300000  tons struck the earth at about 40000 miles an hour scattering white+AC0-hot debris for miles in every direction.

The pilot's hands were sweating the co+AC0-pilot was praying. They touched down and came screeching to a halt just before the edge of the runway the tires smoking. +ACIAIg-HEW+ACE- That was CLOSE+ACEAIgAi- yelled the  captain. +ACIAIg-That runway was SHORT+ACEAIgAi- +ACIAIg-Yeah+ACEAIgAi- said the co+AC0-pilot +ACIAIg-and WIDE too+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

Are you two you know maybe doing something you're not supposed to do?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Absolutely not+ACEAIgAi- the Jim replied. +ACIAIg- We are strictly co+AC0-workers+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Oh yes+ACIAIg- the Sarah replied +ACIAIg- We hike all day record our data return back and fall asleep exhausted. +ACIAIg-That's right+ACEAIgAi- Jim replied +ACIAIg-and me in my tent and she in hers+ACEAIgAi- The crew supervisor spent the remainder of the day in th e field with the pair. He left the field early returned to camp retrieved his Jeep and left the area. The following day the biologist pair had lost their +ACQ-1000 GPS unit. They searched high and low but could not find it. It had simply disappeared from their camp. After a few frantic days they suspected that the crew leader had taken it. It was the only plausible explanation. That evening they called him on the 2+AC0-way radio and politely asked weather he may have inadvertently taken the unit. +ACIAIg-As a matter of fact I did take it the day I came up to see if you two were sleeping together. After realizing I had accidentally taken it with me from the field I placed it in Sarah's sleeping bag where she would be sure to find it+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-
+ACI-Dan had been studying whales for over 20  years and had made some thrilling breakthroughs regarding their  communication. He had managed to decode many of their underwater sounds and to translate them into English. His latest research had proved that they can communicate over a distance of 300 miles. When asked what could they possibly have to say at such distances he replied  +ACIAIg-As best as we can figure it is something like +AC0- Hey can you hear me now?+ACI-
+ACI-Ben was assigned a new wildlife technician and she was driving him crazy. She was blonde and pretty and insisted on carrying beauty products in a little field bag +AC0- nail polish hair care products gels creams and so on.  One day they were driving the rugged four+AC0-wheel drive down a dirt road when a big rabbit ran in front of them and was hit by the truck. Ben pulls over and walks back to the dead rabbit. He felt terrible but there  was clearly nothing he could do for the dead creature.  His blonde partner pipes in and yells +ACIAIg-Waite I have just the  thing+ACEAIgAi- She races back to the truck and begins to rifle through her beauty  products. Ben watches as brushes and combs fly from the bag. Finally she races back with an aerosol can and sprays the dead rabbit with it's contents. Immediately the rabbit springs to its feet waves goodbye hops a few feet pauses and waves again. The rabbit repe ats this strange behavior...wave+AC0-hop+AC0-wave+AC0-hop until it disappears over the hill. Ben is amazed and asks +ACIAIg-What in the world is in that can?+ACIAIg- The blonde biologists says +ACIAIg- Duh...look at the label+ACIAIg- You guessed it....  +ACIAIg-Hair Spray .... Immediately revives dead hair and creates a permanent wave+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-A logger is driving down the highway and sees two botanists trying to measure the height of a small pine tree. Their tape measure is not long enough so one botanist stands on the shoulders of the other and attempts to extend the tape to the tree top but it is not long enough. While trying he falls to the ground. They attempt this about five times and each time the top botanist falls. The logger is laughing but feels sorry for the pair gets out of his truck takes out an electric saw and cuts down the tree. The botanists are looking at him like he is crazy. He then takes a tape measure and measures the tree. +ACIAIg-OK guys the tree is 14' 6.+ACIAIg- He then gets in his truck and drives away. The two botanists are stunned and speechless. Finally one says to the other +ACIAIg-How do you like that we are trying to measure the height of the tree and that stupid jerk measures the width.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-Garvin the mammalogist was in Alaska  studying polar bear. In sub+AC0-zero weather he would spend 7 days out on the ice. But after his 7 days in the field he would return to the small town and spend a day or two resting up and drinking in the only bar in town.  On one particular day it was 40 below zero and Garvin made his way into the bar. He asked Bud the bartender for a whiskey.  +ACIAIg-I don't know Garvin you sure have run+AC0-up a big bill in here.+ACIAIg- The bartender told him. +ACIAIg- I know+ACIAIg- Garvin replied +ACIAIg-But I'm flat broke and I sure could use a drink. +ACIAIg-OK+ACIAIg- The barkeep told him +ACIAIg-I'll just write your tab down on the piece of paper and pin it up here by the coat rack.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Oh no don't do that I don't want everyone in town to see it. +ACIAIg-Don't worry+ACIAIg- The bartender replied +ACIAIg-I'm going to cover it up with your parka until its paid+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-
+ACI-An 8th grade boy was doing some research for his career report at school. He asks his dad +ACIAIg-Father how many wildlife biologists work for the Federal Government?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-The honest father replies +ACIAIg-Oh I would say at least half of 'em.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-A University had advertised for two biologists to help in their mammalogy department specifically with a group of captive grizzly bears. They had only two applicants +AC0- a beautiful young women biologist and an older male biologist. The mammalogist in charge of the project knew that not everyone can handle working with such fierce creatures so he decided to test their  skills with the bears. The two hopefuls followed him out to the bear pen.  He first asked the young women to show him what she could do.  She entered the cage stripped down to her bikini and the largest bear walked up and nuzzled her bare legs.  The astonished mammalogist then said to the old man +ACIAIg-Can you do that?+ACIAIg-  +ACIAIg-You're darn right I can+ACIAIg- said the old man +ACIAIg-just get that bear out of there first +ACEAIgAi-+ACI-
+ACI-A wildlife biologist is working in the woods miles from the nearest town. He's camped alone with his dog and cat as his companions. Suddenly an old gentleman carrying a small limp dog franticly runs into his camp. +ACIAIg-Please please help me+ACE- I think something has happened to Willie. Our Winnebago is parked just around the bend and we've seen you camped here. We didn't know what to do. We thought of you because we had seen all this scientific equipment laying around here. Can you help him?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg- Sir I'm not a vet I'm a wildlife biologist+ACIAIg- the young biologist told the worried man. +ACIAIg-Can you please just have a look at him I'll pay you anything you need. I just need to know. If he's still alive maybe I can rush him into town.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Ok put him here on the table.+ACIAIg- The young biologist looks the limp dog over but its plain that the dog is dead no pulse or signs of breathing. +ACIAIg-I'm sorry  sir but I'm afraid poor Willie is dead.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No I can't believe that..... It can't be true...are you sure?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Yes I'm quite sure.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-I just can't believe that....With all this equipment isn't there something you can do? I must be absolutely sure.+ACIAIg- The biologist called his big yellow cat over to the table. The cat walked around the dead dog occasionally sniffing at the carcass. He then looks up at the biologist and let out a few weak meows. +ACIAIg-Well the cat say he's dead. Does that assure you?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-No I need more than that...Do you have anything else?+ACIAIg- The biologist calls over his big black dog. The dog circles the body a few times sniffing it every now and then. After a few moments the dog barks at the biologist. +ACIAIg-Well now the dog says he's dead. That's all I can do for you  sir.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-OK well I guess its true. I'll take him back and bury him...How  much do I owe you?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-It'll be +ACQ-650 bucks.+ACIAIg- The biologist tells  the old man. +ACIAIg-What??+ACIAIg- replied the old man +ACIAIg-How can you charge that much??+ACEAIQAiACI- +ACIAIg-Well sir I could have told you he was dead for only a dollar but you're the one that insisted on the cat scan and the lab tests+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-
+ACI-A young biologist was sitting on a stump at the edge of their camp. On his face was the saddest hangdog expression. One of the other biologists saw his sad looks and asked +ACIAIg-What's the matter?+ACIAIg- The young biologist said +ACIAIg-They put me in the same tent with old Doctor Perkins. He snores all night takes a bath once a month and talks non+AC0-stop about back when he studied passenger pigeons. He's so damn old I think he was a lackey for Charles Darwin. He generally just makes my life Hell. We had a big fight about it and they split us up for a month+ACIAIg- The older biologist said +ACIAIg-That should make you happy.+ACIAIg-  The young biologist sadly shook his head and said +ACIAIg-Not when the month is up today+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-
+ACI-There were these two Engineers who decided  they would go moose hunting in the backwoods of British Columbia. As it happened they lucked out and got a moose. Unfortunately they were about a mile from their truck. They were having a tough time dragging the animal by the hind legs when a Wildlife Biologist happened upon them. He said +ACIAIg-You know the hair follicles on a moose have a grain to them that causes the hair to lie toward the back. The way you are dragging that moose it increases your coefficient of friction by a huge margin. If you grab it by the antlers and pull you will find the work required to be quite minimal.+ACIAIg-  The Engineers thanked him and started dragging the moose by the  antlers. After about an hour one Engineer said +ACIAIg-I can't believe how easy it is to move this moose this way. I sure am glad we ran across that Biologist.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Yeah.+ACIAIg- said the other. +ACIAIg-But we' re getting further and further away from our truck.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-A biologist from the North Pole was showing a new recruit the ropes of a polar bear radio tracking program. The new recruit said +ACIAIg-I know how the transmitters work but I have one  question+AC0ALQ-how do you catch the polar bears in the first place?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-I bet you use high+AC0-powered tranquilizer dart guns right?+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Oh no+ACEAIgAi- the experienced biologist replied +ACIAIg-we use an ancient Eskimo technique developed centuries ago. First we dig a huge hole in the  ice. Next we place a circle of green peas all the way around the hole.  Then we go hide behind some ice blocks and wait. Finally when a polar bear comes up to take a pea we kick him in the ice+AC0-hole +ACEAIQAhACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-A group of goose biologists were meeting to brainstorm about the migration tactics of Canada geese. They were particularly interested in applying for a +ACQ-100000 Federal grant to investigate the +ACIAIg-V+ACIAIg- formation of goose flight. It had been observed that one side of the +ACIAIg-V+ACIAIg- is always longer than the other side. This group would put together a research proposal to apply for the +ACQ-100000 grant and hopefully find out why this happens. To start off the discussion Todd the Consulting Firm Biologist stands  up and says in typical consultant fashion +ACIAIg-I say we ask for +ACQ-200000  and attempt to model the wind drag coefficients. We can have our  geologists record and map the ground topography and then our staff  meteorologists can predict potential updraft currents. Our internal CAD department can then produce 3+AC0-d drawings of the predicted wing tip vortices. Then after several years of study our in+AC0-house  publications department could produce a nice thick report full of charts and graphs.+ACIAIg- The Senior Research Biologist a professor at the local university cleared his throat and responded +ACIAIg-No no+ACE- That's not it at all. We only need +ACQ-150000. We can train a group of domesticated geese to fly in formations of equal length and then compare their relative fitness to wild geese. We can then publish the results in the Journal of Wildlife Management.  About then the hardworking field biologist stands up and begins walking for the door. +ACIAIg-Where are you going?+ACIAIg- the group asks. +ACIAIg-I'm leaving+ACIAIg- he replies +ACIAIg-I've heard enough. No one has to give me +ACQ-100000 to  find out that the reason one side of the +ACIAIg-V+ACIAIg- is longer is simply  because there are more damn geese on that side+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-
+ACI-A biologist had been working on a remote research project in the Amazon jungle. Upon his return to the States he came down with a terrible illness. After his health had deteriorated his wife took him to a doctor who specialized in strange jungle diseases. The doctor gave him a complete examination and a  series of tests. After receiving the results of the tests the doctor  called the wife into his office alone. He told the young biologist's  wife +ACIAIg-Your husband is suffering from a very severe disease combined with horrible stress. If you don't do the following your husband will surely die.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-Each morning fix him a healthy breakfast. Be pleasant and make sure he is in a good mood. For lunch make him a nutritious meal. For dinner prepare an especially nice meal for him. Don't burden him with chores and generally do anything he asks. Don't discuss your problems with him as it will only make  his stress worse. And most importantly make love with your husband several times a week and satisfy his every whim. +ACIAIg- If you can do this for the next 10 months or so I think your husband will regain his health completely. Otherwise.......well... He'll probably die+ACIAIg- On the way home the husband asked his wife. +ACIAIg-What did the doctor say?+ACIAIg-  she replied. +ACIAIg-Honey.....he says you're probably going to die.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-An old mountain man in Arkansas was sick and bedridden. He had not been outdoors for a few weeks and had a sharp craving for a meal of wild squirrel. He summoned his half+AC0-idiot son into the room and instructed him to go squirrel hunting and bring him back a squirrel or two. He also told his son to be very careful not to shoot the squirrel in the head as he would need its brains later to +ACIAIg-tan+ACIAIg- the squirrel's pelt. (Tanning a skin using the animal's brains is a common practice in certain areas it generally takes about one brain to tan one skin). The idiot son spent most of the day searching the woods for tree squirrels but was not having any luck. Finally high up in a sweet+AC0-gum tree he spotted a squirrel's head sticking out from a hole. He remembered his Pa's admonitions to save the brains. After deciding he may not have  another chance he shot it in the head thus ruining the brains.  r His sick Pa was upset +ACIAIg-I can't tan that skin without no brains+ACEAIgAi- he said +ACIAIg-Now what am I a gonna do?+ACIAIg- Thinking quickly he remembered that up on the river there were 3 fisheries biologists doing some field work. +ACIAIg-Well we're only tanning one squirrel skin walk up the river and shoot one of them dang fish biologists and I'll use his brains to tan the skin+ACIAIg- he told the son. The son did as he was told and soon returned with the prize. As it turned out the brain wasn't large enough and the boy was upset as he would have to make another trip to harvest the other two biologist's brains. +ACIAIg-Look on the bright side boy+ACIAIg- the old man told him +ACIAIg-Two more  ought to be just enough. We'd have been in real trouble if they was  BOTANISTS+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

+ACI-Late one night a burglar broke into a house he thought was empty.  He tiptoed through the living room but suddenly he froze in his tracks when he heard a loud voice say: +ACIAIg-Jesus is watching you+ACEAIgAi-  Silence returned to the house so the burglar crept forward again.  +ACIAIg-Jesus is watching you+ACIAIg- the voice boomed again.  The burglar stopped dead again. He was frightened. Frantically he looked all around. In a dark corner he spotted a bird cage and in the cage was a parrot.  He asked the parrot: +ACIAIg-Was that you who said Jesus is watching me?+ACIAIg-  +ACIAIg-Yes+ACIAIg- said the parrot.  The burglar breathed a sigh of relief and asked the parrot: +ACIAIg-What's your name?+ACIAIg-  +ACIAIg-Clarence+ACIAIg- said the bird.  +ACIAIg-That's a dumb name for a parrot+ACIAIg- sneered the burglar. +ACIAIg-What idiot  named you Clarence?+ACIAIg-  The parrot said +ACIAIg-The same idiot who named the Rottweiller Jesus.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

Recently Germany conducted some scientific exploration involving their best scientists. Core drilling samples of earth were taken to a depth of 50m and during the core examinations small pieces of copper were discovered. After running many arduous tests on these samples the German government announced that the ancient Germans 25000 years ago had a nationwide telephone  network. Naturally the British government was not that easily impressed. So they ordered their own scientists to take their core samples at a depth of 100m. From these samples they found small pieces of glass and soon announced that the ancient Brits 35000 years ago already had a nationwide optical fibre network.  Irish scientists were outraged. So immediately after this announcement they ordered their scientist to take samples at a depth of 200m but found absolutely nothing. They concluded that the ancient Irish 55000  h years ago were an even more advanced civilisation as they already had a mobile telephone network in place.

Calling out to the patient the man says +ACIAIg-Pardon me sir but do you have the time?+ACIAIg- The patient calls back +ACIAIg-One moment+ACEAIgAi- and throws himself upon the ground pulling out a short stick as he does. He pushes the stick into the ground and pulling out a carpenter's level assures himself that the stick is vertical. With a compass the patient locates north and with a steel ruler measures the precise length of the shadow cast by the stick. Withdrawing a slide rule from his pocket the patient calculates rapidly then swiftly packs up all his tools and turns back to the pedestrian saying +ACIAIg-It is now precisely 3:29 pm provided  today is August 16th which I believe it is.+ACIAIg- The man can't help but be impressed by this demonstration and sets his watch accordingly. Before he leaves he says to the patient +ACIAIg-That was really quite remarkable but tell me what do you do on a cloudy day or at night when the stick casts no shadow?+ACIAIg- The patient holds up his wrist and says +ACIAIg-I suppose I'd just look at my watch.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-The two thousand member Baptist church was filled to overflowing capacity one Sunday morning. The preacher was ready to start the sermon when two men dressed in long black coats and black hats entered thru the rear of the church. One of the two men walked to the middle of the church while the other  stayed at the back of the church. They both then reached under their  coats and withdrew automatic weapons. The one in the middle announced +ACIAIg-Everyone willing to take a bullet for Jesus stay in your seats+ACEAIgAi- Naturally the pews emptied followed by the choir. The deacons ran out the door followed by the choir director and the assistant pastor. After a few moments there were about twenty people left sitting in the church. The preacher was holding steady in the pulpit. The men put their weapons away and said gently to the preacher +ACIAIg-All right pastor the hypocrites are gone now. You  may begin the service.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-A man sobering up from the night before is sitting through the Sunday sermon finding it long and boring. Still feeling hung over and tired he finally nods off.  The priest has been watching him all along noticing his apparent hangover and is disgusted. At the end of the sermon the preacher decides to  make an example of him.  He says to his congregation +ACIAIg-All those wishing to have a place in heaven please stand.+ACIAIg-  The whole room stands up except of course the sleeping man.  Then the preacher says even more loudly +ACIAIg-And he who would like to find a place in hell please STAND UP+ACEAIgAi-  The weary man catching only the last part groggily stands up only to find that he's the only one standing.  Confused and embarrassed he says +ACIAIg-I don't know what we're voting on here Father but it sure seems like you and me are the only ones standing for it+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

+ACI-God looks down and notices that Adam is all alone while all the animals have companions so he decides to create a companion for man as well. He comes to see Adam and says to him +ACIAIg-Adam you are my greatest creation and therefore I am going to create for you the ultimate companion.

It was Eve. +ACIAIg-What do you think you're doing?+ACIAIg- Adam demanded.  +ACIAIg-Counting your ribs+ACIAIg- said Eve.+ACI-
A priest and a nun are on their way back home from a trip when their car breaks down. They are unable to get it fixed so they decide to spend the night in a hotel. The only  hotel in the town has only one room available.  Priest: Sister I don't think the Lord would have a problem under the  circumstances if we spent the night together in this one room. I'll sleep on the lounge and you have the bed.  Nun: I think that would be okay.  They prepare for bed and each one takes their agreed place in the room. Ten minutes later...  Nun: Father I'm terribly cold.  Priest: Okay I'll get you a blanket. (He does)  Ten minutes later... Nun: Father I'm still terribly cold.  Priest: Okay Sister I'll get you another blanket. (He does)  Ten minutes later...  Nun: Father I'm still terribly cold. I don't think the Lord would mind if we acted as man and wif e just for this one night. Priest: You're probably right...get up and get your own blanket.
+ACI-A preacher who shall we say was +ACIAIg-humor impaired+ACIAIg- attended a conference to help encourage and better equip pastors for their ministry. Among the speakers were many well known and dynamic speakers. One such boldly approached the pulpit and gathering the entire crowd's attention said +ACIAIg-The best years of my life were spent in the arms of a woman that wasn't my wife+ACEAIgAi- The crowd was shocked+ACE- He followed up by saying +ACIAIg-And that woman was my mother+ACEAIgAi- +AC0- The crowd burst into laughter and delivered the rest of his talk which went over quite well. The next week the pastor decided he'd give this humor thing a try and use that joke in his sermon. As he surely approached the pulpit that sunny Sunday he tried to rehearse the joke in his head. It suddenly seemed a bit foggy to him. Getting to the microphone he said loudly +ACIAIg-The greatest years of my life were spent in the arms of another woma n that was not my wife+ACEAIgAi- The congregation inhaled half the air in the room. After standing there for almost 10 seconds in the stunned silence trying to recall the second half of the joke the pastor finally blurted out +ACIAIg-...and I can't remember who she was+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-
+ACI-A preacher was completing a temperance  sermon: with great expression he said +ACIAIg-If I had all the beer in the world I'd take it and throw it into the river.+ACIAIg- With even greater emphasis he said +ACIAIg-And if I had all the wine in the world I'd take it and throw it into the river.+ACIAIg- And then finally he said +ACIAIg-And if I had all the whiskey in the world I'd take it and throw it into the river.+ACIAIg- He sat down. The song leader then stood very cautiously and announced with a smile +ACIAIg-For our closing song let us sing Hymn +ACM- 365: +ACIAIg-Shall We Gather at the River.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-The preacher was wired for sound with a lapel mike and as he preached he moved briskly about the platform jerking the mike cord as he went.  Then he moved to one side getting wound up in the cord and nearly tripping before jerking it again. After several circles and jerks a little girl in the third pew leaned toward her mother and whispered +ACIAIg-If he gets loose will he hurt us?+ACIAIg-+ACI-
This minister just had all of his  remaining teeth pulled and new dentures were being made. The first Sunday he only preached 10 minutes. The second Sunday he preached only 20 minutes. But on the third Sunday he preached 1 hour 25 minutes. When asked about this by some of the congregation he responded this way. The first Sunday my gums were so sore it hurt to talk. The second Sunday my dentures were hurting a lot. The third Sunday I accidentally grabbed my wife's dentures... and I couldn't stop talking+ACE-
+ACI-A big burly man visited the pastor's home  and asked to see the minister's wife a woman well known for her  charitable impulses. +ACIAIg-Madam+ACIAIg- he said in a broken voice +ACIAIg-I wish to draw your attention to the terrible plight of a poor family in this district. The father is dead the mother is too ill to work and the nine children are starving. They are about to be turned into the cold empty streets unless someone pays their rent which amounts to +ACQ-400.+ACIAIg- +ACIAIg-How terrible+ACEAIgAi- exclaimed the preacher's wife. +ACIAIg-May I ask who you are?+ACIAIg- The sympathetic visitor applied his handkerchief to his eyes. +ACIAIg-I'm the landlord+ACIAIg- he sobbed.+ACI-
+ACI-An old preacher was dying. He sent a message  for his banker and his lawyer both church members to come to his  home. When they arrived they were ushered up to his bedroom. As they entered the room the preacher held out his hands and motioned for them to sit on each side of the bed. The preacher grasped their hands sighed contentedly smiled and stared at the ceiling. For a time no one said anything. Both the banker and lawyer were touched and flattered that the preacher would ask them to be with him during his final moments. They were also puzzled+ADs- the preacher had never given them any indication that he particularly liked either of them. They both remembered his many long uncomfortable sermons about greed covetousness and avaricious behaviour that made them squirm in their seats. Finally the banker said +ACIAIg-Preacher why did you ask us to come?+ACIAIg- The old preacher mustere d up his strength and then said weakly +ACIAIg-Jesus died between two thieves and that's how I want to go.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-It seems that there was a little old church  out in the countryside: painted white and with a high steeple. One Sunday the pastor noticed that his church needed painting. He  checked out the Sunday ads and found a paint sale. The next day he went into town and bought a gallon of white paint. He went back out to the church and began the job. He got done with the first side. It was looking great. But he noticed he had already used a half gallon. He didn't want to run back in town and being the creative person that he was he found a gallon of thinner in the shed out back and began to thin his paint. It worked out great. He finished the remaining three sides with that last half gallon of paint. That night it rained: it rained hard. The next morning when he stepped outside of the parsonage to admire his work he saw that the first side was looking great but that the paint on the oth er three sides had washed away. The pastor looked up in sky in anguish and cried out +ACIAIg-What shall I do?+ACIAIg- A voice came back from the heavens saying +ACIAIg-Repaint and thin no more+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-
+ACI-The Baptist preacher just finished his sermon for the day and proceeded toward the back of the church for his usual greetings and handshaking as the congregation left the church. After shaking a few adult hands he came upon the seven year old son of one of the Deacons of the church.  +ACIAIg-Good morning Jonathan+ACIAIg- the preacher said as he reached out to shake Joanthan's hand.  As he was doing do he felt something in the palm of Jonathan's hand. +ACIAIg-What's this?+ACIAIg- the preacher asked.  +ACIAIg-Money+ACIAIg- said Jonathan with a big smile on his face +ACIAIg-It's for you+ACEAIgAi-  +ACIAIg-I don't want to take your money Jonathan+ACIAIg- the preacher answered.  +ACIAIg-I want you to have it+ACIAIg- said Jonathan. After a short pause Jonathan  continued +ACIAIg-My daddy says you're the poorest preacher we ever had and I want to help you.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-As Bill was approaching mid+AC0-life physically he was a mess. Not only was he going bald but years of office work had given him a large pot belly. The last straw came when he asked a woman co+AC0-worker out on a date and she all but laughed at him. That does it he decided. I'm going to start a whole new regimen. He began attending aerobics classes. He started working out with weights. He changed his diet. And he got an expensive hair transplant. In six months he was a different man. Again he asked his female co+AC0-worker out and this time she accepted.  There he was all dressed up for the date looking better than he ever had. He stood poised to ring the woman's doorbell when a bolt of lightning struck him and knocked him off his feet. As he lay there dying he turned his eyes toward the heavens and said +ACIAIg-Why God why now? After all I've been through how could you do this to me?+ACIAIg-  Fr om up above there came a voice +ACIAIg-Sorry. I didn't not recoginize  you.+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-This fundamentalist Christian couple felt it important to own an equally fundamentally Christian pet. So they went shopping. At a kennel specializing in this particular breed they found a dog they liked quite a lot. When they asked the dog to fetch the Bible he did it in a flash. When they instructed him to look up Psalm 23 he complied equally fast using his paws with dexterity.  They were impressed purchased the animal and went home (piously of course). That night they had friends over. They were so proud of their new fundamentalist dog and his major skills they called the dog and showed off a little. The friends were impressed and asked whether the dog was able to do any of the usual dog tricks as well. This stopped the couple cold as they hadn't thought about 'normal' tricks.  +ACIAIg-Well+ACIAIg- they said +ACIAIg-let's try this out.+ACIAIg-  Once more they called out to the dog and then clearl y pronounced the command +ACIAIg-Heel+ACEAIgAi-  Quick as a wink the dog jumped up put his paw on the man's forehead closed his eyes in concentration and bowed his head.+ACI-
+ACI-The Reverend Billy Graham tells of a time early in his ministry when he arrived in a small town to preach a sermon. Wanting to mail a letter he asked a young boy where the post office was.

+ACI-There's this cathedral that's still being  worked on and the workers have rigged a +ACIAIg-cage elevator+ACIAIg- inside so  they can get material up and down to the upper floors. A characteristic of these +ACIAIg-cage elevators+ACIAIg- is that the doors (gate) must be closed manually for them to be +ACIAIg-called+ACIAIg- to another floor.  One day one of the workers Peter by name takes the elevator to the  top floor and it is subsequently needed on the first floor by the  sexton. Unfortunately Peter forgot and left the door open. After the sexton rings for the elevator a couple times to no avail he yells up for the worker to send the lift back down. Visitors to the cathedral were treated to this sight: The sexton of the cathedral head tipped up yelling up to the heavens:  +ACIAIg-Peter+ACE- CLOSE THE GATES+ACEAIQAhACIAIg-+ACI-

+ACI-God created the donkey +ACY- said to him : +ACIAIg- You will work unceasingly from sunrise to sunset carrying burdens on your back. You will eat grass you will have no intelligence +ACY- you will live 50 years. You will be a donkey. +ACIAIg- The donkey answered: +ACIAIg- I will be a donkey but to live 50 years is too much. Give me only 20 years. God granted his wish. God created the dog and said to him: +ACIAIg-You will be a dog. +ACIAIg- You will guard the house of man. You will be his best friend. You will eat the scraps that he gives you and you will live 25 years. You will be a dog. +ACIAIg- The dog answered: +ACIAIg- Sir to live 25 years is too much you give me only 10 years. God granted his wish. God created the Monkey and said to him: +ACIAIg- You will be a monkey. +ACIAIg- You will swing from branch to branch doing tricks. You will be amusing and you will live 20 years. You will be a monkey. +ACIAIg- The monkey answered: +ACIAIg- Sir to live 20 years is too much  you give me only 10 years. God granted his wish. Finally God created the man and said to him: +ACIAIg- You will be a man the only rational creature on the face of the earth. +ACIAIg- You will use your  intelligence to become master over all animals. You will dominate the world and you will live 20 years. Man responded: +ACIAIg- Sir I will be a man  but to live only 20 years is very little give the 30 years that the  donkey refused the 15 years that the dog did not want and the 10 years  the monkey refused. God granted his wish. And since then man lives 20 years as a man he marries and spend 30 years like a donkey working and carrying all the burdens on his back. Then when his children are gone he lives 15 years like a dog taking care of the house and eating whatever is given to him so that when he is old he can retire and live 10 years like a monkey going from house to house from one son or daughter to another doing tricks to amuse  his grandchildren.+ACI-
+ACI-The Reverend Francis Norton woke up Sunday morning and realizing it was an exceptionally beautiful and sunny early spring day decided he just had to play golf. So.... he told the associate pastor that he was feeling sick and convinced him to say Mass for him that day. As soon as the associate pastor left the room Father Norton headed out of town to a golf course about forty miles away. This way he knew he wouldn't accidentally meet anyone he knew from his parish. Setting up on the first tee he was alone. After all it was Sunday morning and everyone else was in church+ACE- At about this time Saint Peter leaned over to the Lord while looking down from the heavens and exclaimed +ACIAIg-You're not going to let him get away with this are you?+ACIAIg- The Lord sighed and said +ACIAIg-No I guess not.+ACIAIg- Just then Father Norton hit the ball and it shot straight towards the pin dropping just short of it  rolled up and fell into the hole. IT WAS A 420 YARD HOLE IN ONE+ACE- Saint Peter was astonished. He looked at the Lord and asked +ACIAIg-Why did you let him do that?+ACIAIg- The Lord smiled and replied +ACIAIg-Who's he going to tell?+ACIAIg-+ACI-
+ACI-The Chief Rabbi and the Pope are in a  meeting in Rome. The Rabbi notices a fancy shmancy phone on a side table in the Pope's private chambers. +ACIAIg-What's that phone for?+ACIAIg- he asks.  +ACIAIg-It's my direct line to the Lord+ACEAIgAi- the Pope replies. The Rabbi is doubtful but the Pope insists that he tries it out and  indeed he is connected to the Lord and chats away with Him for a while.

So one day deep in prayer as usual he raised his eyes  towards heaven and asked: +ACIAIg-Oh God I honour you every day I ask your advice for every problem and confess to you my every sin. Yet my neighbour who doesn't even believe in you and certainly never prays seems blessed with every happiness while I go poor and suffer many an indignity. Why is this?+ACIAIg- And a great voice w as heard from above: +ACIAIg-BECAUSE HE DOESN'T BOTHER ME ALL THE TIME+ACEAIgAi-+ACI-

Someone who had committed adultery would say they had +ACIAIg-fallen.+ACIAIg- This seemed to satisfy the old priest and things went well until the priest died at a ripe old age. About a week after the new priest arrived he visited the mayor of the town and seemed very concerned. The priest said +ACIAIg-You have to do something about the sidewalks in town. When people come into the confessional they keep talking about having fallen.+ACIAIg-  The mayor started to laugh realizing that no one had told the new priest about the code word. Before the mayor could explain the priest shook an accusing finger at the mayor and said +ACIAIg-I don't know what you're l aughing about your wife fell three times this week.+ACIAIg-+ACI-

One year two guys took the class and did pretty well on all the quizzes and mid+AC0-terms+AC0ALQ-so much so that going into the final they each had a solid A.

A school teacher injured his back and had to wear a plaster cast around the upper part of his body. He wore it under his shirt and it was not noticeable at all. On the first day of the term still with the cast under his shirt he found himself assigned to the toughest class in the school.  Walking confidently into the rowdy classroom he opened the window as wide as possible and then busied himself with desk work. The classroom became a bit unruly and he admonished them. This happened several times.  While working at his desk the strong breeze from the window made his  tie flap annoyingly. He kept rearranging and rearranging the tie as the class become more and more unmanageable.  Finally becoming disgusted with the wayward tie he stood up and took a big stapler off his desk and stapled the tie to his chest in several  places.  Discipline was not a problem from that day forth.

+ACI-An enterprising mayor of the city of Granby Quebec a community south of Montreal established a municipal zoo  that has become a significant tourist attraction. It has also given rise  to many unusual events. Last September one of the star attractions Arnold an Indonesian ape escaped to the dismay of the zoo director. The matter was a serious one because the members of the staff of the zoo while expert at caring for animals had no experience whatsoever in rounding them up or capturing them.  The zoo director appealed to the office of the mayor for help and the  secretary to the mayor asked +ACIAIg-Have you looked in the yellow pages+ACIAIg-? The director said he hadn't but would immediately.  To his surprise under +ACIAIg-animal capturing service+ACIAIg- he found a listing for the Acme Ape Apprehenders. He called them immediately.  Within 20 minutes a panel truck arrived at the admin office of the zoo and  a small man emerged and rushed to the director who was waiting at  the door.  +ACIAIg-Is there a wooded area in the vicinity?+ACIAIg- the little man asked. The director said there was within one half mile from the zoo. +ACIAIg-Hop in the truck+ACIAIg- the little man said. The director did and they drove off.  Minutes later they arrived at a small grove and immediately spotted Arnold on a branch about 25 feet above the ground.  The two men got out went to the back of the truck and the little man opened the door. An excited little dog jumped out and began running around in circles.  The little man reached into the truck and took out a suitcase which he opened. In the suitcase were a pair of handcuffs which he handed to the zoo director a sawed off shotgun which he leaned against the trunk of the tree and a baseball bat.  +ACIAIg-Now+ACIAIg- the little man said +ACIAIg-I'm going up into the tree with the baseball bat and I'm going to knoc k the ape out of the tree. The instant the ape hits the ground the dog well trained will bite the ape by the crotch and chomp+AC0-down with his jaws. The ape will instantly and instinctively grab at his crotch with both hands due to the pain and you snap the handcuffs on and we've got him.  The zoo director pointing to the shotgun leaning against the tree said +ACIAIg-I'm not too sure about this +AC0ALQ- what's the gun for?+ACIAIg-  The little man said +ACIAIg-Look I'm an expert. I know what I'm doing and things will go just fine after all I have the baseball bat. I know my job and it'll never happen but if the ape should by any chance knock ME out of the tree SHOOT THE DOG+ACEAIQAhACIAIg-+ACI-
